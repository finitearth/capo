The word \"dreary\" has a strongly negative connotation, implying that the story is dull and unengaging. The phrase \"middle-class angst\" is somewhat neutral, but in the context of the word \"dreary\", it suggests that the reviewer found the themes or portrayal of middle-class life to be uninteresting or overly focused on negative emotions.\r\n\r\nGiven the negative tone and the lack of any positive language, I would categorize this review as negative. It does not seem to be \"very negative\" because it does not contain extremely strong language or personal attacks, but it clearly expresses dissatisfaction with the cinema.\r\n\r\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:\r\ncombines improbable melodrama -lrb- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -rrb- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .\r\nOutput:\r\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\r\n\r\nTo categorize this cinema review, let's analyze its components:\r\n\r\n1. The review mentions \"improbable melodrama,\" which could be seen as a negative aspect, as it implies that the plot might be unrealistic or overly dramatic.\r\n2. It also talks about \"subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements,\" which could be interpreted as either positive or negative depending on the viewer's taste, but in the context of criticizing melodrama, it might lean towards being seen as negative.\r\n3. However, the review concludes with \"and yet at the end, we are undeniably touched,\" which suggests that despite the criticisms, the film has an emotional impact on the viewer.\r\n\r\nGiven these points, the review acknowledges some negative aspects of the film but ultimately finds it emotionally impactful. This suggests that the overall sentiment is not very negative or negative, as those classifications would not typically include being \"undeniably touched\" by the film. It's also not very positive because the review starts with criticisms. Therefore, the most fitting classification would be positive, as it balances criticisms with a significant positive emotional impact.\r\n\r\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:\r\ndavis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .\r\nOutput:\r\n<final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:",

It intensifies the adjective that follows, indicating a strong negative sentiment.\r\n2. **\"pathetic\"** - This adjective describes something or someone as arousing pity, especially through weakness or inadequacy. It carries a strongly negative connotation.\r\n\r\nGiven the use of \"abysmally\" to intensify \"pathetic,\" the overall sentiment expressed is not just negative but extremely negative.

The actions described, such as \"winces\", \"clutches his chest\", and \"gasps for breath\", suggest a serious or potentially negative situation, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the reviewer's sentiment towards the movie as a whole. However, given the focus on a dramatic moment without any explicit praise or criticism, the sentiment could be interpreted as neutral, as it describes an action without evaluating it as good or bad.\r\n\r\n<final_answer> neutral </final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:\r\nthis low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .\r\nOutput:\r\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:\r\nif i want music , i 'll buy the soundtrack .\r\nOutput:\r\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:",

The comparison to an \"afterschool special\" also has a somewhat derogatory tone, suggesting that the film's themes or execution are overly simplistic or heavy-handed.

Include your final classification within <final_answer> </final_answer>.\r\n\r\nInput:\r\ndreary tale of middle-class angst\r\nOutput:\r\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\r\n\r\nThe review \"\" expresses a negative opinion of the cinema. The word \"dreary\" has a strongly negative connotation, implying that the story is dull and unengaging. The phrase \"middle-class angst\" is somewhat neutral, but in the context of the word \"dreary\", it suggests that the reviewer found the themes or portrayal of middle-class life to be uninteresting or overly focused on negative emotions.\r\n\r\nGiven the negative tone and the lack of any positive language, I would categorize this review as negative. It does not seem to be \"very negative\" because it does not contain extremely strong language or personal attacks, but it clearly expresses dissatisfaction with the cinema.\r\n\r\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:\r\ncombines improbable melodrama -lrb- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -rrb- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .\r\nOutput:\r\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\r\n\r\nTo categorize this cinema review, let's analyze its components:\r\n\r\n1. The review mentions \"improbable melodrama,\" which could be seen as a negative aspect, as it implies that the plot might be unrealistic or overly dramatic.\r\n2. It also talks about \"subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements,\" which could be interpreted as either positive or negative depending on the viewer's taste, but in the context of criticizing melodrama, it might lean towards being seen as negative.\r\n3. However, the review concludes with \"and yet at the end, we are undeniably touched,\" which suggests that despite the criticisms, the film has an emotional impact on the viewer.\r\n\r\nGiven these points, the review acknowledges some negative aspects of the film but ultimately finds it emotionally impactful. This suggests that the overall sentiment is not very negative or negative, as those classifications would not typically include being \"undeniably touched\" by the film. It's also not very positive because the review starts with criticisms. Therefore, the most fitting classification would be positive, as it balances criticisms with a significant positive emotional impact.\r\n\r\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:\r\ndavis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n't feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .\r\nOutput:\r\n<final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:",

It intensifies the adjective that follows, indicating a strong negative sentiment.\r\n2. **\"pathetic\"** - This adjective describes something or someone as arousing pity, especially through weakness or inadequacy. It carries a strongly negative connotation.\r\n\r\nGiven the use of \"abysmally\" to intensify \"pathetic,\" the overall sentiment expressed is not just negative but extremely negative. Therefore, the classification of the sentiment in the review is:\r\n\r\n<final_answer> very negative </final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:\r\ndespite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances .\r\nOutput:\r\n<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\r\n\r\nThe review mentions a negative aspect (\"overwrought ending\") but also a positive aspect (\"the film works as well as it does because of the performances\"). The positive comment seems to outweigh the negative one, as it explains why the film is successful despite its flaws.

The actions described, such as \"winces\", \"clutches his chest\", and \"gasps for breath\", suggest a serious or potentially negative situation, but without more context, it's difficult to determine the reviewer's sentiment towards the movie as a whole. However, given the focus on a dramatic moment without any explicit praise or criticism, the sentiment could be interpreted as neutral, as it describes an action without evaluating it as good or bad.\r\n\r\n<final_answer> neutral </final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:\r\nthis low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers ' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .\r\nOutput:\r\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:\r\nif i want music , i 'll buy the soundtrack .\r\nOutput:\r\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\r\n\r\nInput:",

The comparison of the film to a Twinkie, which is known for being a snack that is easy to consume but lacking in nutritional value, suggests that the reviewer found the film to be similarly lacking in depth or substance.

The comparison to an \"afterschool special\" also has a somewhat derogatory tone, suggesting that the film's themes or execution are overly simplistic or heavy-handed.
