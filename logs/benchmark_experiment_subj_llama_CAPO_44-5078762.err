The term "genius" is particularly subjective, as it is an evaluation of someone\'s intellectual abilities or creativity.\n\n2. **"attempts to build a magnetic engine"** - This action is presented as a factual event within the context of the story. It describes what the character is doing without expressing a judgment about the feasibility, practicality, or morality of the action.\n\n3. **"in hopes of greatly reducing the world\'s consumption of fossil fuels and electricity"** - This part expresses a motivation or goal. The use of "in hopes" suggests an intention or desire, which is subjective, as it reflects the character\'s personal wishes or beliefs about what would be beneficial.\n\nConsidering these points, the sentence combines elements of objective description (the action of attempting to build a magnetic engine) with subjective interpretations (the characterization of the protagonist as a "troubled genius" and the expression of their hopes). However, the overall presentation is more aligned with subjective storytelling\n\nInput: weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: moved in his heart with the urgency to reach out for christ , he gets an idea to try and reach the masses in his city for jesus .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: your night horrors start to bleed into your day job .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Your task is to evaluate the sentence and decide if it contains objective information (facts, measurable data) or subjective content (opinions, judgments, emotions).

The sentence also mentions not feeling much for the main character, which is an emotional response. Therefore, this sentence is subjective as it conveys personal sentiments and appraisals rather than providing factual, impartial data.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , \'what \'s the point ? \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: what they do n\'t know , however , is that they \'re filming near the secret hideout of slobodan pavle , a serbian war criminal .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Evaluate the sentiment of the provided sentence, distinguishing between statements that convey personal opinions and those that provide factual data, and categorize it accordingly as either subjective or objective, responding with the classification, either 'subjective' or 'objective', enclosed within <final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: susie resorts to these to become the most beautiful woman in the world .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: is this dead visitor all in keith 's head or is she truly a mother ghost ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: what they do n't know , however , is that they 're filming near the secret hideout of slobodan pavle , a serbian war criminal .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what 's the point ?

It is factual and does not express any opinion or emotion.\n\n2. **"sendak with his night kitchen theater partner, arthur yorinks and pilobolus artistic directors robby barnett, michael tracy, and jonathan wolken"** - This segment introduces individuals involved in a project, likely a theatrical or dance production, given the mention of "night kitchen theater" and "pilobolus artistic directors." It provides names and roles, which are factual.\n\n3. **"shows us the tenacity and wit that drive the creative process when serious artists work together"** - This part of the sentence describes the outcome or the nature of the collaboration among these artists. The use of the words "tenacity" and "wit" to describe the creative process introduces a subjective interpretation. "Tenacity" and "wit" are positive attributes that reflect an opinion about the quality of the collaboration and the artists involved.\n\nGiven the analysis, the sentence combines\n\nInput: kung pow is oedekerk \'s realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` on guard ! `` wo n\'t be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world \'s best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, we need to identify whether it presents information in a neutral, factual manner or conveys personal views and emotions.\n\nThe sentence includes phrases such as "a whole lot of fun" and "have a whale of a good time," which indicate personal enjoyment and enthusiasm. Additionally, the statement "one of the world\'s best actors" is an opinion, as the ranking of actors can vary based on individual perspectives.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence conveys personal views and sentiments rather than presenting information in a purely neutral, factual manner.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life \'s stasis .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: . . . works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after steve \'s job opportunity in san francisco falls through , he comes up with a plan .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence is subjective or objective, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"after steve \'s job opportunity in san francisco falls through"** - This part of the sentence provides a factual setup for the story. It states an event (a job opportunity falling through) without expressing a judgment or emotion about the event itself. However, the phrase "falls through" can slightly imply a negative outcome, but in the context of setting up a narrative, it\'s more about the event than an emotional judgment.\n\n2. **"he comes up with a plan"** - This part indicates an action taken by Steve as a response to the previous event. It\'s a factual statement about an action without expressing an opinion about the quality, feasibility, or emotional implications of the plan.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence primarily reports on events and actions without expressing a personal view or emotion about those events. It does not contain overt opinions, sentiments, or emotional language that would categorize it as subjective. Therefore, it presents information in a neutral, factual manner.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: he discovers that his daughter \'s life , unknown to him from an affair with a brazilian woman 15 years earlier , is in danger and must return to rio ; having only five days to finish the deal and find his daughter .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence describes a plot or situation involving a character who has a personal connection (a daughter from an affair) and is facing a time-sensitive challenge (finding his daughter and completing a deal within five days). The elements of danger, personal relationships, and urgency are typical of narrative structures found in fiction or personal stories.\n\n2. **Tone and Language**: The language used ("discovers," "life in danger," "must return") suggests a sense of urgency and importance, which is often indicative of a narrative designed to engage the reader or viewer emotionally. There\'s no overt emotional language (like "tragically" or "happily"), but the situation itself evokes a sense of tension or concern.\n\n3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: \n   - **Objective** information would typically be verifiable, factual, and not dependent on personal feelings, interpretations, or prejudices. It presents information as it is, without adding a personal perspective.\n   - **Subjective** information, on the other hand, involves personal opinions, feelings, or biases. It\'s about how someone perceives or interprets a situation, which can vary greatly from person to person\n\nInput:', 'Determine the tone of the given sentence: is it presenting verifiable evidence or conveying a personal viewpoint? Categorize the sentence as subjective, which encompasses emotions, personal opinions, and biased judgments, or as objective, which involves factual, unbiased information. Clearly indicate your classification result within the designated markers as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to signify whether the sentence is rooted in personal perspective or factual data.\n\nInput: a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone of the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"sam mendes"** - This is a proper noun, referring to a person. The mention of a specific individual does not inherently lean towards subjectivity or objectivity.\n2. **"has become valedictorian"** - This part of the sentence is factual. Becoming a valedictorian is an achievement based on academic performance, which can be verified through records.\n3. **"at the school for soft landings and easy ways out"** - This part introduces a subjective element. The name "school for soft landings and easy ways out" does not sound like a real or traditional academic institution. It implies a judgment or opinion about the nature of the school, suggesting it might not be challenging or rigorous.\n\nGiven the analysis, the sentence mixes factual information (becoming valedictorian) with a subjective judgment (the nature of the school). However, the primary subjective element is the description of the school, which conveys a personal viewpoint or bias rather than presenting verifiable evidence about the school\'s academic standards or reputation.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: brad , an art student hoping to win a prestigious fellowship , finds his life and career turned upside down when he falls for a faculty member at his college , lisa ducharme , who just happens to be his girlfriend \'s thesis adviser . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: kung pow is oedekerk \'s realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "kung pow is oedekerk \'s realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that" can be analyzed for its tone and content. The first part of the sentence states a fact about "kung pow" being a realization of Oedekerk\'s childhood dream, which could be considered objective information. However, the second part of the sentence, "and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that," introduces a judgment or opinion about the outcome of Oedekerk\'s dream. This judgment is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal viewpoint or opinion on the success or appropriateness of realizing childhood dreams.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence as a whole is conveying a personal viewpoint, especially with the phrase "should remain just that," which implies a value judgment on the part of the speaker. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it includes a personal opinion or biased judgment.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided expresses a personal viewpoint on the plotting of a film, indicating dissatisfaction and implying that the duration of the film, being around 90 minutes, is generally acceptable but not sufficient to redeem its plotting issues. The use of phrases like "leaves a lot to be desired" clearly conveys a subjective judgment rather than presenting factual, verifiable evidence. Therefore, the tone is subjective, reflecting the speaker\'s personal opinion or bias towards the film\'s plot.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided contains words and phrases that indicate a personal viewpoint, such as "glib," "satirical," "fudges facts," "facile points," and "cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism." These terms convey a negative opinion about the documentary in question, suggesting that it lacks depth, manipulates information, and employs sensationalist tactics. The use of such evaluative language indicates that the sentence is expressing a personal judgment rather than presenting neutral, factual information.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence is analyzing a storyline and the intentions of its creator, Shyamalan, and it includes phrases like "far bigger, far more meaningful story" which indicate a personal interpretation of the story\'s depth and significance. The use of words like "myriad signs" and the overall analysis provided suggest that the sentence is presenting a viewpoint rather than stating a fact. Therefore, the classification of the sentence is:\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

The given sentence expresses a personal opinion about the characters and plot of a movie, using words like "generic", "bland", which are subjective evaluations. The sentence also mentions not feeling much for the main character, which is an emotional response. Therefore, this sentence is subjective as it conveys personal sentiments and appraisals rather than providing factual, impartial data.

Using your understanding of subjectivity vs. objectivity in language, determine if the given sentence is objective (states facts, provides information without personal bias) or subjective (expresses opinions, emotions, or personal judgments). Place your classification between the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: a story about a troubled genius who attempts to build a magnetic engine in hopes of greatly reducing the worlds consumption of fossil fuels and electricity .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **"a story about a troubled genius"** - This part introduces a character with a subjective label ("troubled genius"), which implies a certain level of interpretation or judgment about the character's state or abilities. The term "genius" is particularly subjective, as it is an evaluation of someone's intellectual abilities or creativity.

2. **"attempts to build a magnetic engine"** - This action is presented as a factual event within the context of the story. It describes what the character is doing without expressing a judgment about the feasibility, practicality, or morality of the action.

3. **"in hopes of greatly reducing the world's consumption of fossil fuels and electricity"** - This part expresses a motivation or goal. The use of "in hopes" suggests an intention or desire, which is subjective, as it reflects the character's personal wishes or beliefs about what would be beneficial.

Considering these points, the sentence combines elements of objective description (the action of attempting to build a magnetic engine) with subjective interpretations (the characterization of the protagonist as a "troubled genius" and the expression of their hopes). However, the overall presentation is more aligned with subjective storytelling

( the amazing kreskin ) .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Assess the sentence to discern whether it conveys information in a neutral, fact-based manner that is open to verification, or if it embodies personal viewpoints, feelings, or biases that are inherently subjective. Make a judgment on whether the sentence relies on empirical evidence or individual perspective, and subsequently categorize it as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' by enclosing your classification between the <final_answer> </final_answer> markers, signifying whether the sentence communicates objective truth or personal opinion.\n\nInput: three different scenarios , intercut , all using the same words but with very different meanings .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence discusses "three different scenarios" that are "intercut" and use "the same words but with very different meanings." This description implies an analysis or observation about how the same words can have different meanings based on the context or scenario in which they are used.\n\n2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is descriptive and observational. It does not express a personal opinion or emotion directly but rather presents a situation or observation.\n\n3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: The statement can be seen as objective because it describes a phenomenon (the use of the same words in different scenarios with different meanings) that can be observed and verified. It does not express a personal viewpoint or bias but rather states a fact about language usage that can be empirically observed.\n\n4. **Empirical Evidence**: The phenomenon described can be supported by empirical evidence. For example, linguistic studies often examine how words\' meanings change based on context, and this can be demonstrated through numerous examples across languages.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is more aligned with objective observation than personal opinion, as it describes a verifiable aspect of language use without expressing a personal viewpoint.\n\n<final_answer>\n\nInput: impossible as it may sound , this film \'s heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided conveys a comparison and an evaluation of a film\'s portrayal of human behavior, suggesting that it is more embracing than another entity referred to as "monty." The key elements to analyze here are the phrases "impossible as it may sound," which introduces a subjective judgment, and "this film\'s heart is even more embracing," which directly expresses an opinion about the film\'s nature. Furthermore, the sentence states that the film "accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition," which, while it could be a factual description of the film\'s content, is framed within the context of a subjective evaluation of what makes the film\'s heart "more embracing."\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence embodies personal viewpoints and feelings about the film, comparing it to another entity ("monty") in a manner that is not strictly factual but rather interpretative. The use of words like "embracing" to describe the film\'s portrayal of human flaws indicates a value judgment that is subjective.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: an inept , tedious spoof of \'70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is an evaluation of a film, describing it as an "inept, tedious spoof of \'70s kung fu pictures" and stating it only has enough humor for a short sketch. This assessment is based on the critic\'s opinion of the film\'s quality and comedic value, using words like "inept" and "tedious" which convey a negative personal viewpoint. The use of "almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch, and no more" further emphasizes a subjective judgment on the film\'s ability to entertain. Since the statement reflects personal opinions and feelings about the film rather than presenting verifiable facts, it is not based on empirical evidence that can be universally verified. Therefore, the classification of the sentence is:\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Text categorization exercise: Examine the provided sentence to discern whether it conveys verifiable facts (objective) or embodies personal sentiments, emotions, or biases (subjective), and respond using the specified format: <final_answer>subjective or objective</final_answer>.\n\nInput:', 'Sentence classification challenge: Assess the tone and content of the given sentence to categorize it as either objective, conveying verifiable facts, or subjective, expressing personal sentiments or emotions.

🧟Generated 4 mutated prompts.
😶Generated Prompts: ['To accomplish this classification task, assess the given sentence to discern whether it presents information in a neutral, fact-based manner or if it embodies personal perspectives, sentiments, or biases. Your goal is to categorize the sentence as either objective, characterized by its factual and data-driven content, or subjective, marked by the presence of opinions, emotional undertones, or personal judgments. Upon evaluation, label the sentence with <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if it adheres to verifiable evidence and lacks personal inclination, or with <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if it reflects individual viewpoints, feelings, or speculative assertions.\n\nInput: gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the correspondence between spielrein , freud and jung discovered that day in the geneva basement has become essential to understanding the evolution of psychoanalysis ^ & # 214 ; and the virtually insurmountable challenges facing women who sought to contribute in any role other than that of patient .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components and tone:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence discusses historical figures (Spielrein, Freud, and Jung) and their correspondence, which is a factual, verifiable aspect of history. It also mentions the evolution of psychoanalysis and challenges faced by women, which are topics that can be supported by evidence.\n\n2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is informative and does not express a personal opinion or emotion regarding the individuals or the topic of psychoanalysis. The phrase "virtually insurmountable challenges" could be seen as slightly emotive, but in the context of historical fact, it\'s more descriptive of the obstacles faced by women rather than an expression of the author\'s sentiment.\n\n3. **Objectivity**: The sentence aims to inform about a historical discovery and its significance in understanding psychoanalysis and the challenges women faced in the field. It does not contain overt personal judgments, opinions, or biases that would categorize it as subjective.\n\n4. **Subjectivity**: While the sentence is generally factual, the description of challenges as "virtually insurmountable" introduces a slight subjective element, as it characterizes the degree of difficulty faced by women. However, this characterization\n\nInput: he has just graduated college , he has a beautiful girlfriend , jane , and a publisher has picked up his first novel .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this is the story of their lives , their memories , their unbending habits and the films they love .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: area k is an israeli controlled marine zone isolating the gaza strip and preventing palestinian fishermen from entering israel , egypt and international waters .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components and tone:\n\n1. **Factual Elements**: The sentence mentions "Area K," a specific geographical or administrative designation, and its role as an "Israeli controlled marine zone." This part of the sentence can be verified through factual records or official documents, indicating a level of objectivity.\n\n2. **Description of Function**: It describes Area K as isolating the Gaza Strip and preventing Palestinian fishermen from entering Israel, Egypt, and international waters. This description can be seen as factual, as it outlines the purpose or effect of the marine zone, which can be confirmed through reports, maps, or official statements.\n\n3. **Potential for Bias**: The sentence could be perceived as having a slight negative undertone towards Israel due to the use of the word "preventing," which might imply a restriction or a negative action. However, the primary focus of the sentence is on describing a situation rather than making a value judgment.\n\n4. **Lack of Emotional Language**: The sentence does not contain overtly emotional language or personal opinions. It sticks to describing a situation without using words that would clearly indicate a subjective viewpoint, such as "unjustly," "cruelly," or "wisely."\n\n5.\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the provided sentence to distinguish between verifiable data and personal opinions or emotions, then categorize it as either subjective or objective based on its content, and provide your assessment within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: these blow up another ship with jews , deports and jails the atlantic \'s refugees in palestine , and then deports them to far-off mauritius islands for 5 years in jail : until the end of the war .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>\nThe provided sentence contains a mix of historical events and emotional tone, making it subjective. The description of events such as blowing up a ship, deporting, and jailing refugees can be verified through historical records, which would be considered objective facts. However, the context and the way these events are presented, particularly the emphasis on "jews" and the overall negative portrayal, introduces a subjective perspective. The use of words like "blow up" and the focus on the treatment of specific groups can evoke emotions and suggests a personal opinion or bias against the actions described. Therefore, while the sentence includes verifiable historical data, its presentation and tone are subjective.\n</final_answer>\n\nInput: the transfer to the imax screen diminishes none of the film \'s drama , which was always much more about human emotions than technology .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call \'too clever by half . \'\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Classify the sentiment of the provided sentence as either subjective or objective and respond with the classification, either 'subjective' or 'objective', enclosed within <final_answer> tags for a concise answer.\n\nInput: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot .

This kind of language indicates a personal viewpoint that is critical and disapproving. The use of pejorative terms to describe the art suggests that the statement is influenced by the speaker\'s personal taste and emotions rather than a neutral, factual assessment. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it presents a personal opinion rather than verifiable information or facts.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: stephen stalls his interrogators with stories of his affair with toni , while she risks her freedom by seducing an employee in the d . a . \'s\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , \'what \'s the point ? \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world \'s remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence presents a viewpoint that highlights the diversity of the human population and the potential for healing through creative, natural, and ancient methods. The use of phrases such as "often forgotten fact" and "capacity to heal" suggests a perspective that values and promotes these aspects. The tone is informative but also slightly promotional, indicating a personal viewpoint.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Evaluate the sentence to distinguish between verifiable data and personal perspectives, then categorize it as either objective, which presents information based on facts, or subjective, which conveys personal opinions or biases, and provide your assessment, either 'subjective' or 'objective', enclosed within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:", "Evaluate the provided sentence to distinguish between fact-based content and opinion-driven language, then provide a concise classification, either 'subjective' or 'objective', enclosed within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: a young novelist , tormented by his family 's history and haunted by the specter of his long-dead , more famous ancestor , falls in love with a woman , a distant relative of his ancestor , whose friends and family begin to disappear mysteriously .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: soon after , christin returns as a fierce ghost , and begins to kill all in her path at the hotel as a means for revenge .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: soon , annie 's condition helps leoncio 's children realize the essence of a family .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Assess the tone and intent of the given sentence to determine whether it expresses a personal viewpoint or presents information in a neutral, fact-based manner, and then categorize it accordingly as either subjective or objective, providing your assessment in the specified format, enclosing your chosen classification, either \'subjective\' or \'objective\', within <final_answer> tags: <final_answer>answer</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal viewpoint with the use of words like "must be admitted" and the description of the intensity of the humor as "almost dadaist proportions," which indicates a subjective interpretation of the subject\'s comedic value. The tone is also evaluative, using phrases like "plotless, shapeless" to describe the subject, which further suggests a personal opinion rather than a neutral, fact-based presentation of information. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it reflects the author\'s personal viewpoint and evaluation of the subject\'s humor and structure.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after steve \'s job opportunity in san francisco falls through , he comes up with a plan .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence describes a sequence of events involving a character named Steve and his job opportunity.

This kind of language suggests a strong personal opinion or bias rather than a neutral, fact-based presentation of information. The comparison to "truth or consequences" and the description of characters as "imbecilic mafia toolbags" further emphasize the subjective nature of the statement, as it reflects a personal viewpoint or judgment rather than an objective assessment. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as expressing a personal viewpoint rather than presenting information in a neutral manner.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year \'s worst cinematic tragedies .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the given sentence is critical and disapproving, indicating a strong personal opinion about the movie in question. The use of the word "horrible" and "worst cinematic tragedies" emphasizes the negative sentiment and emotional judgment.

Evaluate the sentence to discern whether it conveys impartial, factual data that can be confirmed, or if it embodies personal sentiments, appraisals, or feelings that are prone to individual variation.

The given sentence expresses a personal opinion about the characters and plot of a movie, using words like "generic", "bland", which are subjective evaluations.

The given sentence expresses a strong negative opinion about a particular type of art, using words like "humorless", "drivel", and stating it was "made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention". This kind of language indicates a personal viewpoint that is critical and disapproving.

The tone seems somewhat informal and possibly narrative, setting up a story or scenario rather than presenting factual data.\n\n2. **Purpose**: The purpose appears to be introductory, setting the stage for a story or discussion about these characters, possibly exploring themes of friendship, racial dynamics, or personal interests. The sentence does not seem to aim at conveying statistical data or factual information about broader groups based on race or interests.\n\n3. **Bias and Perspective**: The choice of names ("blacky" for a white teen and "dumby" for an Aboriginal star) could be seen as biased or stereotypical, suggesting a subjective perspective. The description of "blacky" being more interested in books than sports and "dumby" being the star of the team might reinforce certain stereotypes, indicating a subjective viewpoint.\n\n4. **Sentiment Classification**: Given the narrative tone, the introduction of characters with potentially stereotypical descriptions, and the lack of factual data, the sentence leans towards being\n\nInput: enter nick , charlie \'s best friend , who does his best to help the only way he knows how : distracting charlie with parties and girls .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after steve \'s job opportunity in san francisco falls through , he comes up with a plan .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided reports on a sequence of events involving a character named Steve, without expressing a personal opinion or emotion towards the situation. It simply states that Steve\'s job opportunity fell through and that he then comes up with a plan, without any evaluative language that could suggest a biased perspective. The information given is neutral and does not include any personal feelings or opinions, focusing instead on a factual sequence of events. Therefore, the classification of the sentence\'s sentiment is:\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call \'too clever by half . \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided conveys a negative opinion about the writer-director Stephen Gaghan, using a phrase that implies he has overcomplicated things to his own detriment. The use of the phrase "near-fatal mistake" and "too clever by half" introduces a critical tone, suggesting that the speaker does not approve of Gaghan\'s approach. This kind of language is indicative of personal judgment rather than a neutral or factual report. Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is subjective, as it reflects the opinion or feeling of the speaker towards Gaghan\'s work.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: there \'s undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there \'s nothing else happening .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided expresses a personal opinion about films with movie references, stating that the enjoyment is "undeniable" but also limited, as it "wears thin" when there\'s no other substance. This evaluation of enjoyment and the impact of lacking content is based on personal feelings and opinions rather than factual data. Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is subjective, as it reflects the writer\'s personal view on the matter.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Examine the sentence to determine whether it conveys verifiable evidence or emotive perspectives, and then categorize it as either a factual report or a personal viewpoint, ultimately yielding a classification of \'subjective\' or \'objective\' that will be clearly indicated between the <final_answer> </final_answer> markers.\n\nInput: \'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a critical evaluation of a film, likely "chM-bteau," which seems to be a typographical error and possibly refers to a specific movie title. The use of words like "ludicrous," "contrived," and the phrase "cultural moat" indicates a strong opinion about the plot\'s credibility and the film\'s ability to transcend cultural barriers. This kind of language suggests that the statement is based on personal judgment rather than factual, empirical evidence. The criticism of the plot as "ludicrous and contrived" is a subjective interpretation that may vary from person to person, depending on individual tastes and cultural backgrounds.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: its purpose is to use the precog ( nitive ) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears \' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a negative opinion about a directing debut, using words like "beyond-lame", "pitiful", which are subjective and emotive. The language used is critical and disapproving, indicating a personal viewpoint rather than a factual report. The tone is also informal and evaluative, suggesting that the statement is based on personal taste rather than objective criteria.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: if you \'re part of her targeted audience , you \'ll cheer . otherwise , maybe .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a conditional reaction to someone\'s performance or action, which depends on the audience\'s relationship with the person in question. The use of "you\'ll cheer" and "otherwise, maybe" indicates a personal and variable response based on individual perspectives or feelings towards the person. This suggests that the sentence is conveying an emotive perspective rather than presenting verifiable evidence.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is best categorized as a personal viewpoint because it discusses potential reactions based on personal connections or feelings rather than providing factual information.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about a particular subject, likely a movie or book, and its tone and content. The use of phrases such as "too cerebral for its own good" and "too cerebral for its racy subject matter" indicate a subjective evaluation of the subject\'s balance between intellectual depth and its provocative content. These judgments are based on personal taste and critical perspective rather than on verifiable facts.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: life , love , and the fear of failing . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens \' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child \'s desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence is an analysis of Christopher Hitchens\' perspective on Henry Kissinger, but it is phrased in a way that conveys the opinion of the speaker rather than presenting verifiable evidence. The use of phrases such as "one is left with the inescapable conclusion" and "a sophisticated flower child\'s desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power" suggests a personal interpretation or viewpoint. The language used is emotive and interpretive, indicating that the statement is more of a subjective analysis than an objective report.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses an evaluation of the values that have helped the enterprise crew in their adventures, highlighting courage, self-sacrifice, and patience under pressure. This evaluation is based on the narrator\'s interpretation of the crew\'s behavior and the significance of these values, rather than on quantifiable data or empirical evidence. The use of words like "courage" and "self-sacrifice" implies a level of subjective judgment about what constitutes admirable or effective behavior under challenging circumstances.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is more aligned with a personal viewpoint, as it reflects an assessment or opinion about the crew\'s values and their impact, rather than presenting verifiable facts or data.

The given sentence expresses a strong negative opinion about a particular type of art, using words like "humorless", "drivel", and stating it was "made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention". This kind of language indicates a personal viewpoint that is critical and disapproving.

😶Generated Prompts: ["Our goal is to distinguish between sentences that convey factual, impartial information and those that embody personal feelings, opinions, or biases. To achieve this distinction, evaluate each sentence to ascertain whether it is rooted in tangible evidence and unbiased data or shaped by personal perspectives, and then categorize the sentiment of the given sentence as either subjective, reflecting personal views, or objective, based on verifiable facts. Provide your classification, clearly marked as either 'subjective' or 'objective', within the <final_answer> tags, to succinctly convey whether the sentence is subjective or objective, ensuring the response is formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for easy identification.\n\nInput: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: susie resorts to these to become the most beautiful woman in the world .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Examine the provided sentence to discern whether it conveys verifiable, unbiased data or embodies personal opinions, emotions, or assessments that are susceptible to personal perspectives. Assess whether the statement is grounded in empirical, quantifiable facts or influenced by individual perception, and subsequently label it as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: just teetering south of puberty , young thomas harris has discovered that instead of looking at stars , he can use his new telescope to study the beautiful woman next door .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, let\'s break it down into its components and analyze its nature:\n\n1. **Content Description**: The sentence describes a scene involving a young character, Thomas Harris, and his use of a telescope. It mentions his age relative to puberty and his choice of using the telescope to observe a neighbor rather than astronomical objects.\n\n2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is narrative and descriptive, setting a scene that could be part of a story. The tone seems to be observational and slightly humorous, given the unexpected use of the telescope.\n\n3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: \n   - **Objective** statements are typically based on verifiable evidence, quantifiable data, and are less likely to change based on the observer\'s perspective. They aim to report facts without personal bias.\n   - **Subjective** statements, on the other hand, reflect personal opinions, feelings, or biases. They can vary greatly from person to person and are often influenced by individual experiences, emotions, and perspectives.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence "just teetering south of puberty, young Thomas Harris has discovered that instead of looking at stars, he can use his new telescope to study the beautiful woman next door" is more aligned with\n\nInput: the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it \'s begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a negative opinion about the Merchant-Ivory team and their impact on cinema. The use of strong language such as "systematically destroy" and "do even more damage" indicates a personal assessment rather than a neutral, factual report. The statement reflects the speaker\'s emotional perspective and subjective evaluation of the team\'s work, rather than presenting verifiable, empirical data.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: naxalites are becoming more and more popular among tribles because of their capacity to give instant justice and more and more youths are joining them .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **"Naxalites are becoming more and more popular among tribles"** - This part of the statement could be considered subjective because the term "popular" can be perceived differently by various individuals. Popularity can be measured in various ways, including the number of supporters, the level of influence, or the frequency of positive mentions in media or community discussions. However, without specific, quantifiable data, the claim of increasing popularity remains subjective.\n\n2. **"because of their capacity to give instant justice"** - This reason provided for the Naxalites\' popularity introduces a subjective judgment. The concept of "instant justice" can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives and values. What one person considers justice, another might not. This part of the statement reflects a value judgment rather than an objective fact.\n\n3. **"and more and more youths are joining them"** - Similar to the first part, the claim that "more and more youths are joining them" could be subjective without concrete, empirical evidence. It implies an increase in membership among youths, but without specific numbers or data, it\'s difficult to verify the extent of this trend.\n\nGiven these considerations, the statement\n\nInput: is this dead visitor all in keith \'s head or is she truly a mother ghost ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the given sentence to determine whether it presents factual information or expresses personal viewpoints. Your goal is to categorize the sentence as either objective, which includes verifiable evidence or quantifiable observations, or subjective, which encompasses personal beliefs, sentiments, or biases. Clearly label the sentence as \'subjective\' or \'objective\' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> markers to indicate its nature.\n\nInput: humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: grace \'s only salvation appears to be by the guidance of her paternal grandfather reverend salo sr . ( the amazing kreskin ) .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a young novelist , tormented by his family \'s history and haunted by the specter of his long-dead , more famous ancestor , falls in love with a woman , a distant relative of his ancestor , whose friends and family begin to disappear mysteriously .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve \'s novel proved too difficult a text to \'lick , \' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: naxalites are becoming more and more popular among tribles because of their capacity to give instant justice and more and more youths are joining them .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life \'s stasis .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the film contains colour home movie footage of the film \'s production which where shot by charles \' brother sydney .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence discusses a specific film and its content, mentioning "colour home movie footage" of the film\'s production.\n2. **Source of Information**: It specifies that the footage was shot by "Charles\' brother Sydney," providing a clear origin for the footage.\n3. **Nature of the Statement**: The statement reports on a factual aspect of the film, detailing its content and the source of the footage.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence is reporting on verifiable information about the film\'s content and production. It does not express a personal opinion, sentiment, or bias towards the film or its production quality. Therefore, it is categorized as objective because it provides quantifiable observations about the film.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Evaluate the sentence to distinguish between verifiable data and personal perspectives, then categorize it as either objective, which presents information based on facts, or subjective, which conveys personal opinions or biases, and provide your assessment, either 'subjective' or 'objective', enclosed within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput:"]

Input: humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The given sentence expresses a strong negative opinion about a particular type of art, using words like "humorless", "drivel", and stating it was "made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention". This kind of language indicates a personal viewpoint that is critical and disapproving. The use of pejorative terms to describe the art suggests that the statement is influenced by the speaker's personal taste and emotions rather than a neutral, factual assessment. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it presents a personal opinion rather than verifiable information or facts.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The given sentence expresses a strong negative opinion about a particular type of art, using words like "humorless", "drivel", and stating it was "made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention". This kind of language indicates a personal viewpoint that is critical and disapproving. The use of pejorative terms to describe the art suggests that the statement is influenced by the speaker's personal taste and emotions rather than a neutral, factual assessment. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it presents a personal opinion rather than verifiable information or facts.

The sentence does not present verifiable information, but rather a personal assessment of the movie\'s quality.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: in 1999 , after one of their husbands became ill with leukemia , the women came up with a more commercial concept : discreet photos of these bare wi lasses .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given sentence, it\'s essential to break down its components and analyze the nature of the information presented. The sentence discusses a specific event involving a group of women and their response to a personal situation, namely, one of their husbands becoming ill with leukemia. This event led to the women coming up with a more commercial concept involving discreet photos.\n\nThe key elements to consider in determining the sentiment and nature of the sentence are:\n\n1. **Factual Information**: The sentence provides specific, verifiable details such as the year (1999) and the illness (leukemia), which are objective facts.\n2. **Personal or Emotional Context**: The situation described involves personal circumstances (a husband becoming ill) and the women\'s response to it, which introduces an element of personal viewpoint or emotion.\n3. **Commercial Concept**: The mention of the women coming up with a "more commercial concept" suggests a business or entrepreneurial decision, which, while influenced by personal circumstances, is presented in a factual manner.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence primarily conveys information that can be verified (the year, the illness, the action taken by the women) but is set against a backdrop of personal circumstances. However, the overall presentation of the information does\n\nInput: he discovers that his daughter \'s life , unknown to him from an affair with a brazilian woman 15 years earlier , is in danger and must return to rio ; having only five days to finish the deal and find his daughter .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the sentiment of the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. The sentence describes a plot or situation involving a character\'s personal life and emotions, indicating elements of a personal viewpoint.\n2. It mentions specific events and circumstances (an affair, a daughter in danger, a time constraint) that could be part of a narrative or story, suggesting a presentation of information that is part of a fictional or personal context rather than verifiable, factual data.\n3. The sentence does not express a clear opinion or emotion directly but sets up a scenario that could evoke emotions or opinions in a reader or viewer, depending on the context in which it\'s presented.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence seems to present a scenario that is part of a story or narrative, which typically involves personal viewpoints or emotional elements, even if the sentence itself does not directly express an opinion. However, since it describes a situation without expressing a direct opinion or emotion about the situation, it could be seen as setting up a scenario rather than stating a personal viewpoint. But considering the context of categorization for sentiment analysis, which often looks for the presence of personal opinions or emotions, and given that this sentence describes a personal and emotional situation, it leans towards being subjective in the context of\n\nInput: `` on guard ! `` wo n\'t be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world \'s best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about the movie "On Guard" and its entertainment value, as well as the performance of the actor Daniel Auteuil. The use of phrases such as "a whole lot of fun" and "have a whale of a good time" indicate a subjective evaluation. Therefore, the sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: an ancient tablet found by famous british archaeologist professor hyde-white is believed to be a roadmap to the legendary lost temple of faramundi and its hidden treasures .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the sentiment of the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"an ancient tablet found by famous British archaeologist Professor Hyde-White"** - This part of the sentence provides information about an event (the discovery of a tablet) and the person involved (Professor Hyde-White). The description of the archaeologist as "famous" could introduce a subjective element, but in the context of the sentence, it primarily serves to establish the credibility or significance of the discovery rather than express a personal viewpoint.\n\n2. **"is believed to be a roadmap to the legendary lost temple of Faramundi and its hidden treasures"** - The phrase "is believed to be" indicates that the status of the tablet as a roadmap is not a fact but rather an interpretation or hypothesis. The belief could be based on expert opinion or evidence, but it introduces an element of subjectivity because beliefs can vary among individuals. However, the sentence does not express a personal emotion or viewpoint of the speaker; it reports on a belief presumably held by others (possibly experts or the archaeologist).\n\nGiven this analysis, while the sentence contains elements that could be considered subjective (the interpretation of the tablet\'s significance, the belief in its purpose), it primarily presents\n\nInput: it is best appreciated as an immersion in a three-dimensional toyland outfitted with enough whimsical gadgetry to fill a thousand playrooms .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided conveys a personal viewpoint or emotion, as it describes something being "best appreciated" in a specific manner, which is a subjective evaluation. The use of words like "whimsical" also adds to the subjective nature of the sentence, as it expresses a personal or emotional response to the described environment.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: emma \'s a succesful sale agent for a home security company , due in part to being the police chief \'s daughter .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the sentiment of the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. The sentence mentions "emma" as a successful sales agent, which is a factual statement about her profession.\n2. It attributes her success "due in part to being the police chief\'s daughter," which introduces an element of potential bias or advantage due to her personal connection.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence presents information that can be verified (Emma\'s profession and her relationship to the police chief), but it also implies a personal viewpoint or emotion by suggesting that her success is partly due to her family connection, which could be seen as an opinion on the nature of her success.\n\nHowever, the core information (her job and her father\'s position) is verifiable, making the sentence more objective in nature, as it reports on facts rather than expressing a clear emotion or personal viewpoint directly.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: this film puts wang at the forefront of china \'s sixth generation of film makers .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'To efficiently differentiate between sentences that convey impartial, evidence-based content and those that embody personal sentiments or biases, evaluate the nature of the information presented in each sentence.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

The classification of each sentence as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' should be clearly indicated within the <final_answer> tags, facilitating a rapid differentiation between impartial, factually accurate sentences and those that express personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the classification explicitly stated as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for easy identification.\n\nInput: the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: three different scenarios , intercut , all using the same words but with very different meanings .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "three different scenarios, intercut, all using the same words but with very different meanings" can be classified as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> because it provides a factual description of a situation without expressing a personal opinion or emotion.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

The use of the term "kitsch appeal" and the comparison to specific cultural icons indicates a personal viewpoint on what is considered interesting or aesthetically pleasing. The sentence does not provide empirical evidence or universally accepted facts to support its claims but rather expresses a personal opinion on the value and purpose of the subject in question.\n\nThe tone of the sentence is reflective of personal taste and cultural critique, which is inherently subjective. The comparison to specific cultural artifacts and the judgment of something being "interesting, but not for its original purpose" suggests a personal interpretation and evaluation rather than a factual, objective assessment.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence is evaluative and critical, expressing strong negative opinions about various aspects of a film, including acting, cinematography, direction, writing, and violence. The use of words such as "amateurish," "atrocious," "clumsy," "insipid," "luridly graphic," and "laughably unconvincing" indicates a personal judgment rather than a neutral, factual assessment. These terms reflect the writer\'s subjective experience and emotional response to the film, rather than providing an objective analysis based on empirical evidence or universally accepted criteria.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this is the story of their lives , their memories , their unbending habits and the films they love .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: impossible as it may sound , this film \'s heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence presents information that is rooted in personal viewpoints and sentiments, as it expresses an opinion about the film\'s heart being "even more embracing" than another entity, and also makes a value judgment about the film\'s acceptance of "nasty behavior and severe flaws" as part of the human condition. The use of phrases such as "impossible as it may sound" and "even more embracing" also suggests a subjective tone, as they convey a personal perspective and emotional inclination. Therefore, the sentence\'s tone is subjective, as it expresses personal opinions and emotional inclinations rather than presenting impartial, factual data.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: that is , until he falls in love with a cocktail waitress ( maria bello ) and gets `` lady luck , `` which throws the situation into reverse .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is making a comparison between the film "Gangs" and a "good spaghetti western" in terms of entertainment value. The use of the phrase "as fun to watch" introduces a subjective evaluation of the film\'s enjoyability, which can vary greatly from person to person. The comparison to a "spaghetti western" also implies a personal taste in film genres.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

For the purpose of categorizing sentences into two distinct groups, it is essential to recognize the difference between sentences that convey information in an impartial and factual way, and those that are colored by the presence of personal feelings or biases. The objective of this task is to evaluate each sentence carefully to ascertain whether it is rooted in verifiable, factual information or if it embodies the expression of individual perspectives, emotions, or prejudices. When reading through the sentences, the crucial decision to be made is whether the content is objective, presenting verifiable facts, or subjective, conveying personal opinions. The classification of each sentence should be clearly indicated as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags to facilitate an efficient distinction between sentences that are factually correct and unbiased, and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the classification formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for easy identification.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

For the purpose of categorizing sentences into two distinct groups, it is essential to recognize the difference between sentences that convey information in an impartial and factual way, and those that are colored by the presence of personal feelings or biases. The objective of this task is to evaluate each sentence carefully to ascertain whether it is rooted in verifiable, factual information or if it embodies the expression of individual perspectives, emotions, or prejudices. When reading through the sentences, the crucial decision to be made is whether the content is objective, presenting verifiable facts, or subjective, conveying personal opinions. The classification of each sentence should be clearly indicated as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags to facilitate an efficient distinction between sentences that are factually correct and unbiased, and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the classification formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for easy identification.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Analyze the tone and language of the given sentence to determine whether it presents information in a neutral and factual way or if it expresses personal views or emotions. The aim is to separate sentences that provide unbiased, evidence-based information from those that are shaped by individual perspectives or feelings. To achieve this, examine each sentence to decide if it is based on verifiable facts or if it reflects personal opinions, sentiments, or biases. The task involves classifying each sentence as either \'subjective\', indicating the presence of personal opinions, or \'objective\', indicating a focus on factual, unbiased information. Classify the sentence as \'subjective\' or \'objective\' and enclose your answer in <final_answer> </final_answer> tags for easy identification, enabling a clear distinction between fact-based, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for straightforward recognition.\n\nInput: it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the given sentence is critical and disapproving, indicating a personal opinion about the quality and excitement of the subject being discussed. The use of phrases such as "feels like an after-school special" and "as exciting as gazing at an egg timer" convey a negative emotional tone and subjective judgment. \n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: \'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Determine the nature of the provided sentence, categorizing it as either subjective, which encompasses personal feelings, biases, or perspectives, or objective, which comprises verifiable, factual data, and encapsulate your classification within <final_answer> tags, using the designations \'subjective\' for sentences that convey personal opinions or emotions and \'objective\' for those that present information based on facts, thereby distinguishing between the expression of individual viewpoints and the presentation of factual, unbiased information.\n\nInput: robert harmon \'s less-is-more approach delivers real bump-in -the-night chills -- his greatest triumph is keeping the creepy crawlies hidden in the film \'s thick shadows .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe provided sentence is subjective because it expresses a personal opinion about Robert Harmon\'s approach and the effect it has on the audience, using phrases like "delivers real bump-in-the-night chills" which is an emotional response. The sentence also includes the phrase "his greatest triumph" which implies a value judgment.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the tone and intent of the given sentence, determining whether it expresses a personal perspective or presents information based on evidence, and label it as either subjective, indicating a personal opinion or emotional tone, or objective, signifying a neutral and fact-based statement, and provide the classification result, formatted as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, to clearly indicate the sentence\'s classification as either a personal sentiment or a factual report.\n\nInput: it \'s hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about the length and quality of something, likely a piece of writing, film, or other creative work. The use of the word "flabby" to describe something as being too long or verbose, despite being short, indicates a subjective judgment based on personal taste or standards of quality. The phrase "it\'s hard to believe" also suggests a sense of surprise or incredulity, which is an emotional tone. Therefore, the sentence is classified as subjective because it reflects the speaker\'s personal perspective and emotional response.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: but though his tortillas are scrumptious , his enchiladas devine , isidor has never made a dime .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the film contains colour home movie footage of the film \'s production which where shot by charles \' brother sydney .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is stating a fact about the film, specifically that it contains color home movie footage of its production shot by Sydney, Charles\' brother. There is no emotional tone or personal opinion expressed in the sentence. It is presenting information in a neutral manner.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: your night horrors start to bleed into your day job .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: carlos works in the east village as an inker of comics , but is developing his own project he hopes to sell to a well-known publisher .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the tone and intent of the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence provides information about Carlos\'s current job and his aspirations. It mentions specific details such as his workplace (East Village) and his profession (inker of comics), as well as his personal goal (developing his own project to sell to a publisher).\n\n2. **Tone**: The tone appears to be neutral and informative. It does not express a clear opinion or emotion towards Carlos\'s job, his aspirations, or the potential outcome of his project. The language used is straightforward and factual.\n\n3. **Intent**: The intent seems to be to inform the reader about Carlos\'s professional activities and his career goals. There is no apparent attempt to persuade, criticize, or praise, which are common characteristics of subjective statements.\n\n4. **Evidence**: The statement does not present any explicit evidence (such as statistics, expert opinions, or research findings) to support its claims. However, it does provide specific details that could be verified (e.g., Carlos\'s job title and location). The lack of explicit evidence does not necessarily make the statement subjective, as it primarily aims to convey factual information about an individual\'s career.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is\n\nInput: ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life \'s stasis .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Develop a classification system to categorize sentences into two distinct groups: those that embody personal viewpoints, emotions, or biases, and those that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner. The primary objective is to discern between sentences that are rooted in empirical evidence and those that are shaped by individual perspectives or sentimental undertones. To achieve this, it is essential to evaluate each sentence and determine whether it is grounded in objective, verifiable data or if it reflects subjective interpretations, opinions, or emotional resonance. The classification process involves labeling each sentence as either \'subjective\' to indicate the presence of personal opinions or biases, or \'objective\' to denote a focus on factual, unbiased information. Ensure that the classification is clearly marked within <final_answer> tags, using the format <final_answer>answer</final_answer>, to facilitate effortless differentiation between sentences that convey personal viewpoints and those that present verifiable, impartial information.\n\nInput: that is , until he falls in love with a cocktail waitress ( maria bello ) and gets `` lady luck , `` which throws the situation into reverse .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: three different scenarios , intercut , all using the same words but with very different meanings .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, we must evaluate whether it presents information in a neutral, fact-based manner or if it embodies personal viewpoints, emotions, or biases.\n\nThe sentence "three different scenarios, intercut, all using the same words but with very different meanings" can be analyzed as follows:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence discusses the concept of different scenarios and the use of the same words with varying meanings. This concept is more about the structure or technique of storytelling or communication rather than expressing a personal opinion or emotion.\n2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is descriptive and analytical, focusing on the method or technique of presenting scenarios rather than expressing a personal viewpoint or emotion.\n3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: The sentence does not contain overt personal opinions, biases, or emotional undertones. It describes a situation or technique that can be observed or analyzed based on empirical evidence, such as in film, literature, or any form of storytelling.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is more aligned with presenting information in a neutral, fact-based manner, as it describes a technique or phenomenon without expressing a personal opinion or bias.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: years of guilt and sorrow tumble over each other as vince struggles to retain his sanity and understand who it is he is hoping to find alive .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

🧟Generated 4 mutated prompts.
😶Generated Prompts: ['Examine the provided sentence to discern whether it conveys emotion or fact, and then categorize it as either an expression of personal sentiment or a presentation of factual information, ultimately responding with a classification of \'subjective\' or \'objective\' within the designated <final_answer> markers to denote the sentence\'s nature.\n\nInput: he has just graduated college , he has a beautiful girlfriend , jane , and a publisher has picked up his first novel .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence conveys emotion or fact and categorize it accordingly, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. "he has just graduated college" - This is a factual statement about an event that has occurred.\n2. "he has a beautiful girlfriend, jane" - The description of Jane as "beautiful" introduces a subjective judgment, as beauty is in the eye of the beholder. However, the fact that he has a girlfriend named Jane can be considered factual.\n3. "and a publisher has picked up his first novel" - This is also a factual statement about an event or situation.\n\nGiven the mix of factual information and a subjective evaluation ("beautiful"), the sentence overall contains elements of both objective fact and subjective opinion. However, the primary content of the sentence (graduation, having a girlfriend, and a publisher picking up his novel) can be verified and is thus factual. The subjective element ("beautiful") is an adjective used to describe Jane but does not alter the factual nature of the events or relationships described.\n\nConsidering the overall content and purpose of the sentence, it leans more towards presenting factual information with a minor subjective descriptor. Therefore, the classification of the sentence, taking into account the context provided, would be more \'objective\' due\n\nInput: fontaine \'s direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence conveys emotion or fact, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. The sentence discusses Fontaine\'s direction and specific techniques she used, such as close-ups and moving camera work.\n2. It describes these techniques as "agreeably startling" and states that they create "sheerly cinematic appeal."\n   - The use of "agreeably startling" introduces a subjective judgment about the effect of the techniques.\n   - "Sheerly cinematic appeal" also implies a value judgment on the aesthetic or artistic impact of the direction.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence includes evaluations and opinions about Fontaine\'s direction, indicating that it is not merely a factual report but includes personal sentiment or subjective evaluation.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: this holds particularly true for blacky , a white teen who is more interested in books than sport , and his best friend , dumby , the aboriginal star of the team .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence conveys emotion or fact and categorize it accordingly, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence describes two individuals, their interests, and their ethnic backgrounds. It presents specific details about their personalities and hobbies without directly expressing a personal opinion or emotion about these characteristics.\n\n2. **Language and Tone**: The language used is descriptive and informative. There\'s no overt emotional appeal or language that suggests a subjective judgment (e.g., words like "amazing," "wonderful," "terrible") that would typically indicate a personal sentiment.\n\n3. **Purpose**: The purpose appears to be informative, aiming to introduce characters and their traits rather than to persuade or evoke an emotional response from the reader.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is primarily presenting information about the characters without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. Therefore, it is categorized as a presentation of factual information.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life \'s stasis .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: susie resorts to these to become the most beautiful woman in the world .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: in the 1870s , jacobina , daughter of german immigrants to southern brazil , starts to break with both the catholic and lutheran churches to preach body healing through soul cleansing .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence conveys emotion or fact and categorize it accordingly, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: The sentence mentions a specific time period ("in the 1870s") and a geographical location ("southern Brazil"), which suggests a factual setup.\n2. **Biographical Information**: It introduces a character, "Jacobina," who is described in relation to her parents ("daughter of German immigrants"), providing more factual background.\n3. **Action Description**: The sentence describes Jacobina\'s actions ("starts to break with both the Catholic and Lutheran churches to preach body healing through soul cleansing"), which can be seen as a factual account of her activities, even though the subject matter involves religious beliefs and practices.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence primarily presents historical and biographical information without expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the events or Jacobina\'s beliefs. It reports on actions and circumstances in a neutral manner, aiming to inform rather than persuade or evoke an emotional response.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: little ella \'s birthright is the gift - and curse - of obedience .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Evaluate the sentiment of the provided sentence, distinguishing between statements that convey personal opinions, feelings, or biases, and those that provide verifiable evidence and factual content. Classify the sentence accordingly, using the labels 'subjective' for personal perspectives and 'objective' for factual information, and enclose your classification within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags to clearly denote the distinction between emotional or personal expressions and factual representations of reality.\n\nInput: humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: that is , until he falls in love with a cocktail waitress ( maria bello ) and gets `` lady luck , `` which throws the situation into reverse .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what 's the point ?

The language used is also lyrical and emotive, suggesting a subjective perspective.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence uses language that is descriptive and emotive, with words like "byzantine" and "libido" that convey a sense of complexity and sensuality. The tone is expressive and suggestive, indicating a personal interpretation or opinion rather than a neutral, factual report. \n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Determine whether a given sentence is subjective, which would indicate the presence of personal feelings or biases, or objective, which would signify the presentation of verifiable facts, and then categorize the sentence as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' based on this determination, placing the classification within <final_answer> tags to clearly indicate whether the sentence expresses a personal opinion or states a factual piece of information.\n\nInput: set in the rugged mountains and lush , untamed forests of the pacific northwest , tribe of joseph is an engrossing tale of troubled youths plucked from the familiarity of their urban lives and transported into the alien isolation and life or death danger of a survivalist existence .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the given sentence is subjective or objective, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Setting Description**: The sentence starts with a descriptive description of the setting, "set in the rugged mountains and lush, untamed forests of the Pacific Northwest." This part of the sentence provides a factual backdrop for the story, as it describes geographical features that can be verified.\n\n2. **Story Introduction**: It then introduces "Tribe of Joseph" as "an engrossing tale," which begins to introduce a subjective element. The word "engrossing" implies an opinion about the quality or impact of the tale, suggesting that it is captivating or interesting. This is a subjective judgment because what one person finds engrossing, another might not.\n\n3. **Plot Description**: The description of the plot, involving "troubled youths" being "plucked from the familiarity of their urban lives" into a survivalist existence, presents a scenario that could be either factual or fictional, depending on the context. However, the use of words like "troubled" and the dramatic description of their situation ("alien isolation and life or death danger") introduces a subjective interpretation of the characters\' experiences and the challenges they face.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence\n\nInput:']

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Analyze the provided sentence to discern its tone, distinguishing between statements that convey verifiable evidence (objective) and those that embody personal perspectives or emotional undertones (subjective), then categorize the sentence as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' and enclose your assessment within <final_answer> tags to signify whether the sentence represents a factual account or a personal sentiment.\n\nInput: cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that \'s not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the tone of the provided sentence, let\'s break it down into its components:\n\n1. "cold and scattered" - This phrase is subjective as it describes an emotional or qualitative assessment of something, likely the movie "Minority Report."\n2. "minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals" - This statement, while focusing on a specific aspect of the movie (its visuals), implies a personal perspective on what makes the movie interesting. The use of "almost solely" suggests a limitation in the movie\'s appeal, which is a subjective judgment.\n3. "that\'s not vintage Spielberg" - This is a subjective statement comparing the movie to the director\'s previous works, implying a personal expectation or standard for what constitutes "vintage Spielberg."\n4. "and that, finally, is minimally satisfying" - This conclusion is subjective, as "minimally satisfying" expresses a personal sentiment regarding the movie\'s ability to meet expectations or provide enjoyment.\n\nGiven the analysis, the sentence is dominated by personal perspectives and emotional undertones rather than verifiable evidence. Therefore, it is categorized as subjective.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: anyone who can count to five ( the film \'s target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the provided sentence is critical and disapproving, with a hint of sarcasm. The use of the phrase "dumbed-down concoction" and the rhetorical question about the film\'s target market convey a negative personal opinion about the film. The statement "anyone who can count to five... can see where this... is going" is also subjective, as it implies that the outcome is obvious, but the obviousness is based on the speaker\'s personal perspective.\n\nThe sentence does not provide any verifiable evidence or objective facts about the film. Instead, it expresses a personal sentiment and emotional tone, which is negative and dismissive.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wan na have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the tone of the provided sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **"this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari"** - The use of "bold" and "lyrical" to describe the feature suggests a positive and artistic appreciation, which introduces a subjective element.\n2. **"expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wan na have fun"** - The phrase "pat notion" implies a common or oversimplified belief, and the casual expression "just wan na have fun" seems to undermine or simplify the complexity of the topic, which can be seen as subjective.\n3. **"into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment"** - The word "rousing" is positive and emotive, and "treatise of sensual empowerment" suggests a deep and possibly subjective interpretation of the theme of empowerment.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence is more subjective than objective because it includes personal perspectives and emotional undertones through its choice of words and the way it frames the topic.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the tone of the provided sentence, we need to break it down into its components and assess whether it presents verifiable evidence or personal perspectives/emotional undertones.\n\n1. **"the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans"** - This part of the sentence suggests a criticism of the script\'s originality or lack thereof. The use of "too many" indicates a subjective judgment about the quantity of familiar plot devices or comedic elements. The phrase "tried-and-true shenanigans" is somewhat neutral but, in this context, implies a negative view of relying on familiar tropes.\n\n2. **"that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy"** - This continuation emphasizes the lack of uniqueness or originality in the script by comparing it unfavorably to other teen comedies. The word "hardly" strengthens the subjective criticism, implying a significant lack of distinction.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence conveys a personal perspective or opinion about the script\'s quality and originality. It does not present verifiable evidence but rather an evaluation based on the writer\'s or speaker\'s subjective experience or standards of what constitutes original or engaging content in a teen comedy.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'For the purpose of categorizing sentences into distinct groups, evaluate the tone and content of each sentence to ascertain whether it conveys information from a detached, factual standpoint or if it is colored by the presence of personal feelings, biases, or opinions.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

The use of the phrase "typical Hollywood disregard" suggests a preconceived notion or bias against Hollywood\'s approach to historical topics. Furthermore, the mention of finding entertainment in the experiences of certain characters implies a subjective evaluation of the content\'s enjoyability. The tone is not purely factual but rather opinionated, as it reflects the speaker\'s feelings and attitudes towards the subject matter.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: a murder in the camp gives him the chance to set a risky plan in motion .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the tone of the given sentence, "a murder in the camp gives him the chance to set a risky plan in motion," let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Neutral, Unbiased Manner**: The sentence reports an event (a murder) and its consequence (setting a plan in motion) without directly expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the event itself. It does not contain overtly emotional language or value judgments.\n\n2. **Objective, Factual Content vs. Sentiment**: The language used is straightforward and descriptive of actions and their consequences. The term "risky" could be seen as slightly evaluative, implying a judgment about the plan, but in the context of setting a plan in motion following a significant and presumably disruptive event like a murder, "risky" can also be seen as a factual assessment of the situation\'s potential outcomes.\n\n3. **Tone Assessment**: The tone is primarily informative, aiming to convey what happens as a result of the murder. While the word "risky" introduces a slight element of interpretation, the overall sentence structure and choice of words do not convey a strong emotional appeal or personal perspective.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence can be classified as more **objective** than subjective because it primarily reports\n\nInput: evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the tone of the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence uses words like "frustration," "awkwardness," and "euphoria," which are emotional states. This indicates that the sentence is describing a personal or emotional experience rather than a purely factual one.\n\n2. **Subjectivity**: The use of the word "usual tropes" suggests a judgment or opinion about common portrayals of growing up, implying that the speaker or writer has a perspective on what is typical or clichéd. This further suggests subjectivity.\n\n3. **Objective vs. Subjective Content**: While the sentence does describe a universal experience (growing up), the way it\'s framed (focusing on emotions and criticizing common portrayals) introduces a personal perspective. Objective content would likely focus on factual aspects of growing up without emotional judgment.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence embodies personal perspectives and emotions, using language that reflects sentiment rather than purely factual, objective content.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the internment of 120 , 000 innocent people was a dark moment in the history of this country .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: shot on wide screen digibeta , sendak with his night kitchen theater partner , arthur yorinks and pilobolus artistic directors robby barnett , michael tracy , and jonathan wolken shows us the tenacity and wit that drive the creative process when serious artists work together .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: he has just graduated college , he has a beautiful girlfriend , jane , and a publisher has picked up his first novel .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Assess the tone and intent of the given sentence to determine whether it presents information in a neutral, factual manner or expresses a personal viewpoint, and then classify it accordingly as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal opinions or emotions, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable facts, and provide the classification result, either 'subjective' or 'objective', within <final_answer> tags for a direct answer.\n\nInput: the hand that eluded him his entire life , the one that held the cigarettes , and the hand he will never hold again .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: like carlos and mickey , sean and eddie are best friends .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: woody allen plays val waxman , a film director , who was once big in the 1970 's and 1980 's , but has now has been reduced to directing tv commercials .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the given sentence is informative, providing details about a character, Val Waxman, played by Woody Allen, and his career trajectory.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

😶Generated Prompts: ["Assess the tone and intent of the given sentence, differentiating between expressions of personal viewpoint and presentations of verifiable information, and rapidly assign it to either the 'subjective' or 'objective' category, enclosing your one-word classification within <final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: however after his son is witness to a killing he has done mike sullivan finds him self on the run trying to save the life of his son and at the same time looking for revenge on those who wronged him .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: that is , until he falls in love with a cocktail waitress ( maria bello ) and gets `` lady luck , `` which throws the situation into reverse .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Classify the sentiment of a given sentence by discerning whether it conveys a personal perspective, emotion, or opinion, thereby rendering it subjective, or if it presents information that can be verified, making it objective, and denote your classification by enclosing it within <final_answer> tags as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\', effectively separating statements rooted in personal feelings from those grounded in factual evidence.\n\nInput: with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion by comparing a movie to "high humidity" and calling it "a dog of a movie", which is a colloquialism for something of poor quality. This comparison is rooted in personal taste and emotional response, rather than presenting verifiable information. Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: originality ai n\'t on the menu , but there \'s never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the given sentence is subjective because it expresses a personal opinion about the comic, using phrases like "never a dull moment" which indicates an evaluation or judgment. \n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: he is haunted by the ghost of his deceased brother paul who guides him toward his salvation .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it \'s a bad , embarrassing movie .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about a movie, using words like "bad" and "embarrassing" to describe it. This indicates that the statement is influenced by the speaker\'s personal feelings and taste in movies, rather than presenting verifiable facts. Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is subjective, as it conveys a personal perspective on the movie\'s quality.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Determine the nature of each sentence by evaluating its tone and content, distinguishing between those that convey factual, unbiased information and those that express personal views or emotions. Categorize sentences into two groups: 'subjective' for those that embody individual perspectives, feelings, or prejudices, and 'objective' for those that present verifiable, neutral data. Clearly denote your classification decision using the <final_answer> tags, enclosing either 'subjective' or 'objective' to facilitate the differentiation between impartial, fact-based sentences and those that carry the weight of personal opinion or emotional resonance, ensuring the response is formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for easy identification.\n\nInput:", 'Classify the sentiment of the given sentence, distinguishing between subjective language that expresses personal opinions, emotions, or biases, and objective language that presents factual information and verifiable evidence, and then clearly indicate your classification by enclosing it within <final_answer> tags as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' to effectively differentiate between personal perspectives and factual statements.\n\nInput: 77 minutes of pokemon may not last 4ever , it just seems like it does . my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about a movie, specifically mentioning a desire to avoid watching it and referencing a negative experience. The language used, such as "may not last 4ever, it just seems like it does" and "my only wish is that celebi could take me back to a time before i saw this movie and i could just skip it," indicates a subjective viewpoint, as it conveys the speaker\'s emotions and biases towards the movie.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: lars von trier re-explores the concept of goodness , but this in an idiom very different from that of his gold heart trilogy ( breaking the waves , the idiots and dancer in the dark ) .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence discusses Lars von Trier\'s exploration of the concept of goodness in a different manner compared to his previous works, known as the "Gold Heart Trilogy." This statement provides information about the filmmaker\'s thematic approach and compares it to his earlier projects. Since it presents an analysis of his work without expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the quality or value of that work, it can be considered as presenting factual information about the filmmaker\'s thematic exploration.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: they create a new day care facility called `` daddy day care `` and have kids like : the smart-mouthed-but-became-polite crispin ( shane baumel ) , the really-smart becca ( hailey noelle johnson ) , and the flash/tony ( jimmy bennett ) .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it does n\'t have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses personal opinions and emotions, using phrases such as "i like" and "still love", which indicate a personal preference. The sentence also compares the quality of the storyline, stating that it "doesn\'t have the same magical quality", which is a subjective evaluation. Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is subjective, as it presents the speaker\'s personal opinions and feelings.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: dildo diaries takes a lighthearted but \'probing \' approach to exploring the development of sections of the texas penal code and its effects on the adult sex toy industry .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: he has just graduated college , he has a beautiful girlfriend , jane , and a publisher has picked up his first novel .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence describes a series of events and facts about an individual\'s life, including graduating from college, having a girlfriend, and getting a novel published. These are presented as factual statements without any emotional tone or personal opinion. The use of the word "beautiful" to describe the girlfriend could be seen as subjective, as beauty is often a matter of personal opinion. However, in the context of the sentence, it is used to provide a positive attribute of the girlfriend, which is a common way to describe someone in a factual manner without necessarily expressing a personal opinion. Overall, the sentence aims to inform about the person\'s achievements and relationships rather than to express an opinion or emotion.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: disturbing for its unabashed honesty , our cast of characters both love and despise each other , their very actions acknowledging the pressures inherent in a tightly bonded peer group .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

This setup is narrative and does not express a personal opinion about the events but rather sets a scene.\n\n2. **Tone**: The tone is light-hearted and suggests entertainment, indicated by the description of the tale as "comic" and the mention of "comic mishappenings." This tone is more aligned with storytelling than with expressing a personal viewpoint or emotion.\n\n3. **Language**: The language used is descriptive and neutral, focusing on the plot of a story rather than evaluating or judging the characters\' actions or the situation emotionally.\n\n4. **Purpose**: The purpose appears to be informative about the plot of a story, aiming to engage or interest the reader in the narrative, rather than to persuade or express a personal opinion.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is more about presenting a scenario or a story outline than about expressing a personal opinion or emotion. Therefore, it leans towards being a factual statement about the content of a story rather than a subjective expression of feelings or biases.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer\n\nInput: the plan to make enough into M-^Qan inspiring tale of survival wrapped in the heart-pounding suspense of a stylish psychological thriller \' has flopped as surely as a soufflM-i gone wrong .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the film delivers what it promises : a look at the `` wild ride `` that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: and if she \'s lucky , she may find love along the way .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after a really wild night jim and the gang wake up in an abandoned warehouse in a small town in the middle of no where , of which they have never heard of .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the sentiment of the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"after a really wild night"** - This phrase suggests an exciting or unusual event occurred, which could be interpreted as a subjective experience since the term "wild" can vary greatly in meaning from person to person.\n2. **"jim and the gang wake up in an abandoned warehouse"** - This part of the sentence describes a situation or event without expressing a clear opinion or emotion directly. It\'s more about what happened.\n3. **"in a small town in the middle of no where"** - The use of "no where" (presumably "nowhere") is colloquial and subjective, as the perception of a place being in the middle of nowhere can vary greatly from person to person. It implies a sense of remoteness or isolation, which is a subjective interpretation.\n4. **"of which they have never heard of"** - This indicates a lack of prior knowledge about the town, which is a factual statement about the characters\' state of knowledge but doesn\'t express an opinion or emotion about the town itself.\n\nConsidering these points, the sentence combines elements of factual description (what happened, where they are) with subjective interpretations (\n\nInput:', 'To determine the tone of a sentence, you need to figure out if it\'s based on facts and data or if it\'s influenced by personal feelings or perspectives, making a distinction between subjective sentences that reflect individual opinions or emotions and objective sentences that provide verifiable information. Then, categorize the sentence as either subjective, which means it contains opinion-based or emotional content, or objective, which means it contains factual and verifiable information, and place your categorization, which can be either \'subjective\' or \'objective\', within <final_answer> tags to indicate whether the sentence represents a personal opinion or a factual statement.\n\nInput: kung pow is oedekerk \'s realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone of the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"kung pow is oedekerk\'s realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick"** - This part of the sentence provides information about the movie "Kung Pow" and its relation to Oedekerk\'s childhood dream. It can be seen as a factual statement about the background or inspiration behind the movie.\n\n2. **"and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that"** - This part introduces a judgment or opinion about the outcome of realizing one\'s childhood dreams, specifically in the context of the movie "Kung Pow". The phrase "should remain just that" implies a value judgment on whether certain dreams should be pursued or left as mere aspirations. This judgment is subjective because it reflects a personal viewpoint on the desirability of pursuing childhood dreams.\n\nGiven the analysis, the sentence contains both factual information (about the movie and its inspiration) and a subjective opinion (about the wisdom of pursuing childhood dreams). However, the overall tone and the second part of the sentence clearly express a personal opinion or viewpoint, which makes the sentence subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Determine whether a sentence is subjective, which involves personal feelings or biases, or objective, which is based on verifiable evidence, and then clearly label your classification between <final_answer> tags as either \'subjective\' for sentences that reflect personal opinions or \'objective\' for sentences that state facts, allowing for the differentiation between emotional expressions and factual reports.\n\nInput: though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it \'s exploitive without being insightful .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: dildo diaries takes a lighthearted but \'probing \' approach to exploring the development of sections of the texas penal code and its effects on the adult sex toy industry .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"Dildo Diaries"** - This is the title of a work, presumably a documentary, book, or similar, and does not in itself convey subjectivity or objectivity.\n2. **"takes a lighthearted but \'probing\' approach"** - The use of "lighthearted" and "\'probing\'" suggests a subjective interpretation of the approach taken by "Dildo Diaries." The word "lighthearted" especially implies a tone that is subjective, as what one person considers lighthearted, another might not.\n3. **"to exploring the development of sections of the Texas Penal Code"** - This part of the sentence refers to a factual aspect, the exploration of legal code developments, which could be considered objective as it deals with verifiable information.\n4. **"and its effects on the adult sex toy industry"** - Similar to the previous point, this part discusses the impact on an industry, which can be analyzed with factual data, suggesting an objective aspect.\n\nHowever, the overall tone and the choice of words like "lighthearted" and "\'probing\'" introduce a\n\nInput: three different scenarios , intercut , all using the same words but with very different meanings .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "three different scenarios, intercut, all using the same words but with very different meanings" can be classified as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> because it describes a situation without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. It provides an observation about the use of words in different scenarios, which can be verified or observed, making it a factual statement rather than a subjective interpretation.\n\nInput: but though his tortillas are scrumptious , his enchiladas devine , isidor has never made a dime .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: its purpose is to use the precog ( nitive ) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence discusses the purpose of using the precognitive potential of genetically altered humans for a specific goal, which is to prevent murders. This goal is presented as a factual statement about the purpose of an initiative or program.\n\n2. **Language and Tone**: The language used is straightforward and descriptive, focusing on the function or objective of a particular group or project. There\'s no emotional appeal, personal opinion, or bias evident in the statement.\n\n3. **Verifiability**: While the concept of genetically altered humans with precognitive abilities is currently in the realm of science fiction, the sentence itself is structured as a factual statement about the purpose of such a program. If this were a real program, the statement about its purpose could be verified through documentation or official statements about the program\'s goals.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is presenting information as a fact about the purpose of a program, without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. Therefore, it is classified as objective.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: simon calms his prot & # 233 ; g & # 233 ; that genuine happiness only comes from the inside .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: on the whole , the movie lacks wit , feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "on the whole, the movie lacks wit, feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality" is subjective because it expresses a personal opinion about the movie, using words like "lacks," "coarseness," and "banality," which convey a negative emotional tone and evaluation.

The sentence mentions a specific individual, Slobodan Pavle, referred to as a "Serbian war criminal." This part of the sentence is based on factual information, as it identifies a person and his alleged role or actions.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Evaluate the sentence\'s emotional tone and purpose, separating personal perspectives from factual reports, and quickly categorize it as either subjective, which includes personal opinions and feelings, or objective, which includes verifiable data, and then label it with a one-word answer, \'subjective\' or \'objective\', enclosed in <final_answer> tags, to indicate whether the sentence expresses a personal sentiment or states a fact.\n\nInput: hawke \'s film , a boring , pretentious waste of nearly two hours , does n\'t tell you anything except that the chelsea hotel today is populated by whiny , pathetic , starving and untalented artistes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence\'s emotional tone is negative, with words like "boring", "pretentious", "whiny", "pathetic", and "untalented" expressing a strong personal opinion. The purpose of the sentence is to criticize and express disdain for Hawke\'s film and the people it portrays. The language used is subjective and evaluative, indicating a personal perspective rather than a factual report. \n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Analyze the provided sentence to discern its tone, deciding whether it conveys verifiable evidence (objective) or embodies personal perspectives or feelings (subjective), and encapsulate your judgment within <final_answer> </final_answer> tags, designating it as either 'subjective' to denote personal biases or 'objective' to signify factual data.\n\nInput: when all but one of mi5 's top agents are killed in an explosion .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the film contains colour home movie footage of the film 's production which where shot by charles ' brother sydney .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided appears to convey factual information about the content of a film, specifically mentioning the inclusion of color home movie footage and the person who shot it, Sydney, who is the brother of Charles. There is no apparent emotional language, opinion, or bias in the statement. It presents information in a neutral manner, suggesting that it is based on verifiable evidence.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: however after his son is witness to a killing he has done mike sullivan finds him self on the run trying to save the life of his son and at the same time looking for revenge on those who wronged him .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Evaluate the sentence to distinguish between verifiable facts and personal opinions, then classify it as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' and enclose your classification within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags to effectively separate factual statements from emotionally charged or personally biased expressions.\n\nInput: soon , annie \'s condition helps leoncio \'s children realize the essence of a family .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: epic battles , spectacular effects and multiple story lines make the two towers a most excellent middle chapter in the lord of the rings film trilogy .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentence, let\'s break it down into its components:\n\n1. "epic battles" - This can be considered a subjective evaluation since what one person considers "epic," another might not. It\'s an opinion about the quality or scale of the battles.\n2. "spectacular effects" - Similar to "epic battles," this is a subjective judgment about the quality of the special effects in the movie.\n3. "multiple story lines" - This can be considered a verifiable fact. The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, specifically "The Two Towers," does indeed have multiple story lines.\n4. "make the two towers a most excellent middle chapter" - This is a subjective opinion. The use of "most excellent" indicates a personal judgment about the quality of the film as a middle chapter in the trilogy.\n\nGiven the analysis, the sentence contains both verifiable facts ("multiple story lines") and personal opinions ("epic battles," "spectacular effects," "most excellent middle chapter"). However, the overall sentiment and evaluation of the film are subjective.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "it\'s hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby" expresses a personal opinion or subjective evaluation of something, likely a piece of writing, film, or other form of content. The use of the word "flabby" to describe the content is a value judgment that reflects the speaker\'s personal taste or opinion, rather than a verifiable fact. The phrase "it\'s hard to believe" also indicates a sense of surprise or incredulity, which is a subjective emotional response.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: susie resorts to these to become the most beautiful woman in the world .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Develop a classification system to categorize sentences into two distinct groups: subjective and objective. This entails scrutinizing the language and purpose of each sentence to discern whether it conveys a personal perspective or presents factual, unbiased information. The primary objective is to create a clear differentiation between sentences that are rooted in empirical evidence and those that are colored by individual emotions, beliefs, or biases. For each sentence, determine whether it belongs to the 'subjective' category, which is characterized by the presence of personal opinions or emotional undertones, or the 'objective' category, marked by a neutral, fact-based tone. Clearly denote your classification decision using the <final_answer> tags, such as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, to facilitate an efficient distinction between sentences that offer verifiable information and those that express personal viewpoints, thereby enabling a straightforward identification of the sentence's nature and its classification as either subjective or objective.\n\nInput: disturbing for its unabashed honesty , our cast of characters both love and despise each other , their very actions acknowledging the pressures inherent in a tightly bonded peer group .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: soon after , christin returns as a fierce ghost , and begins to kill all in her path at the hotel as a means for revenge .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: years of guilt and sorrow tumble over each other as vince struggles to retain his sanity and understand who it is he is hoping to find alive .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: however after his son is witness to a killing he has done mike sullivan finds him self on the run trying to save the life of his son and at the same time looking for revenge on those who wronged him .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:"]

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases.

Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

The novel\'s position on the best-seller list - This is a verifiable fact as it can be checked against current best-seller lists.\n2. The mention of Hollywood\'s interest - This could be considered a fact if it\'s based on actual interest or announcements from Hollywood, but without specific details, it leans towards being a statement of potential or rumor.\n3. The statement about the author\'s dedication to writing despite potential distractions - This part expresses a personal trait or behavior of the author, which could be seen as subjective as it reflects an opinion about the author\'s commitment.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence combines factual information (the novel\'s success) with a subjective interpretation of the author\'s dedication and the potential impact of Hollywood\'s interest.

The sentence also expresses a positive opinion about the movie "Pinocchio" and its potential to become a Christmas perennial, which further suggests a subjective tone.\n\nThe sentence can be broken down into factual and emotional/biased expressions as follows:\n- Factual information: The movie "Pinocchio" exists and is directed by Benigni.\n- Emotional/biased expressions: The opinion that the movie could become a Christmas perennial, the comparison of coal to the movie as a substitute for naughty children\'s stockings, and the overall positive tone towards the movie.\n\nGiven the presence of personal opinions and emotional language, the classification result is:\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence describes the values of the enterprise crew in a positive light, using words like "courage", "self-sacrifice", and "patience under pressure".

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

This speculation about the nature of reality, especially concerning supernatural elements, tends to lean towards personal belief or interpretation rather than verifiable fact.\n\n3. **Subjective vs. Objective**: The sentence does not present a verifiable, factual claim but rather poses a question about the interpretation of an experience. The experience itself (seeing a ghost) is not universally accepted as factual and varies greatly depending on personal beliefs, cultural background, and individual experiences. Therefore, the discussion about whether the ghost is "all in Keith\'s head" or "truly a mother ghost" involves personal sentiment\n\nInput: but throughout these years , she keeps in touch with her mother via letters to prison .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone of the sentence "but throughout these years, she keeps in touch with her mother via letters to prison," let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Language and Intent**: The sentence is stating a fact about a person\'s action (keeping in touch) and the method (via letters to prison). The phrase "but throughout these years" suggests a continuation or a contrast to a previous statement, which might imply a slight emotional undertone due to the context it\'s setting. However, the core of the sentence focuses on a factual action.\n\n2. **Emotional Undertones**: While the situation described (a mother in prison and the daughter keeping in touch) can evoke emotions, the sentence itself does not express a personal sentiment or emotional appeal directly. It reports on an action without judgment or emotional language.\n\n3. **Biased Viewpoints**: There\'s no apparent bias in the sentence. It does not take a stance or try to persuade the reader towards a particular viewpoint regarding the situation.\n\n4. **Verifiable, Factual Content**: The action described (keeping in touch via letters) is something that can be verified. The sentence presents this action as a fact without expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the situation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the\n\nInput: the two friends devise a plan to dress up in drag , commit a minor felony , get caught and then sent to the same prison in order to retrievie the ticket .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone of the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence describes a plan involving dressing up in drag, committing a minor felony, getting caught, and being sent to prison to retrieve a ticket. This plan is unconventional and involves illegal activities, which already suggests a narrative or plot rather than a factual report.\n\n2. **Language and Intent**: The language used is descriptive of a sequence of actions that are part of a plan. There\'s no emotional language or personal opinion expressed about the morality, feasibility, or desirability of the plan. The intent seems to be to convey a plot or a storyline rather than to persuade, criticize, or praise.\n\n3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: \n   - **Subjective** sentences typically express personal opinions, emotions, or biases. They often include words or phrases that indicate a personal viewpoint or feeling.\n   - **Objective** sentences, on the other hand, present verifiable information without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. They aim to inform or describe facts.\n\nGiven the context, the sentence appears to be describing a plot or a scenario, possibly from a story, without expressing any personal sentiment or emotional undertone regarding the actions described. It does not\n\nInput:']

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases.

Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

Classify the sentiment of a given sentence by discerning whether it conveys a personal perspective, emotion, or opinion, thereby rendering it subjective, or if it presents information that can be verified, making it objective, and denote your classification by enclosing it within <final_answer> tags as either 'subjective' or 'objective', effectively separating statements rooted in personal feelings from those grounded in factual evidence.

Input: with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The given sentence expresses a personal opinion by comparing a movie to "high humidity" and calling it "a dog of a movie", which is a colloquialism for something of poor quality. This comparison is rooted in personal taste and emotional response, rather than presenting verifiable information. Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is subjective.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Determine the nature of a sentence\'s meaning by evaluating whether it reflects a personal stance, emotional tone, or biased judgment, categorizing it as subjective, or if it provides factual, verifiable details, rendering it objective. Analyze the sentence\'s language and purpose to distinguish between expressions of individual perspective and presentations of empirical data, and label it as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' by enclosing your assessment within <final_answer> tags, thereby distinguishing between sentiment-driven statements and fact-based assertions.\n\nInput: devastated by her husband \'s death from a drug overdose , philippa ( played by cate blanchett ) , a british teacher living in turin , italy , tries to bring justice to the biggest drug dealer in turin when the local police ignore her information about him .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the nature of the sentence\'s meaning, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Emotional Tone**: The sentence starts with "devastated," which is an emotional state. This indicates a personal feeling or reaction, suggesting a subjective element.\n2. **Personal Stance**: The description of Philippa\'s actions and motivations ("tries to bring justice") implies a personal stance or perspective, further indicating subjectivity.\n3. **Biased Judgment**: The portrayal of the local police as ignoring her information could be seen as a judgment, which may also lean towards subjectivity.\n4. **Factual Details**: The sentence includes specific, verifiable details such as the location (Turin, Italy), the profession of the character (British teacher), and the action taken by the character (trying to bring justice to a drug dealer). These details could be considered objective as they provide factual information.\n5. **Purpose**: The purpose of the sentence appears to be informative, setting the scene for a story or plot. However, the inclusion of emotional and judgmental language influences the reader\'s perception, making it somewhat subjective.\n\nGiven these considerations, while the sentence contains factual elements, its overall tone, the inclusion of emotional states, and the implied judgment on the\n\nInput: however after his son is witness to a killing he has done mike sullivan finds him self on the run trying to save the life of his son and at the same time looking for revenge on those who wronged him .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: like carlos and mickey , sean and eddie are best friends .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the nature of the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence uses the phrase "dog days of August," which is an idiomatic expression for the hottest and most humid period of the summer. It then metaphorically compares a movie to "high humidity," suggesting discomfort or unpleasantness. The tone is clearly negative and critical, indicating a personal opinion rather than a neutral or factual report.\n\n2. **Purpose**: The purpose of the sentence appears to be expressing a negative opinion about a movie, using a creative and somewhat humorous analogy to convey the writer\'s dissatisfaction. This is indicative of a subjective stance, as the evaluation of a movie\'s quality is inherently personal and can vary greatly from one individual to another.\n\n3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: The sentence does not provide any factual, verifiable details about the movie, such as its plot, production quality, or reception. Instead, it offers a metaphorical comparison that reflects the writer\'s personal feelings towards the movie. This lack of empirical data and the presence of a clear emotional tone suggest that the sentence is subjective.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is best categorized as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it reflects a personal\n\nInput: that is , until he falls in love with a cocktail waitress ( maria bello ) and gets `` lady luck , `` which throws the situation into reverse .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Analyze the provided sentence to determine its emotional tone, deciding whether it expresses a personal viewpoint, emotional response, or biased judgment, categorizing it as subjective, or if it provides factual, unbiased data, categorizing it as objective, and then encapsulate your classification between <final_answer> </final_answer> tags, clearly distinguishing between sentiment-driven and fact-based statements.\n\nInput: without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it \'s a bad , embarrassing movie .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about a movie, using words like "bad" and "embarrassing" to describe it. This indicates that the statement is influenced by the speaker\'s personal feelings and taste in movies, rather than presenting verifiable facts. Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is subjective, as it conveys a personal perspective on the movie\'s quality.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the mothman prophecies , which is mostly a bore , seems to exist only for its climactic setpiece .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal viewpoint and emotional response, as indicated by the use of the word "bore", which is a subjective judgment. The sentence also contains a biased opinion about the purpose of "the mothman prophecies", implying that it lacks value beyond a specific scene. This type of language suggests a subjective tone, driven by the author\'s sentiment and personal taste.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: a corrupt cia agent ( johnny depp ) who at that time , demands retribution from his worst enemy to carry out the drug lord \'s uprising against the government .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, we need to break it down into its components and assess the language used to determine its emotional tone and whether it expresses a personal viewpoint, emotional response, or biased judgment, or if it provides factual, unbiased data.\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence describes a character, a "corrupt CIA agent" played by Johnny Depp, who is seeking "retribution from his worst enemy" to facilitate a "drug lord\'s uprising against the government." The use of the word "corrupt" already implies a negative judgment or bias against the character. The context of seeking retribution and being involved in a drug lord\'s uprising also carries a negative connotation, suggesting illegal and morally questionable activities.\n\n2. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: The description of the CIA agent as "corrupt" and the involvement in illegal activities introduces a subjective judgment. The terms used are not neutral; they convey a negative opinion about the character\'s actions and morals. This subjectivity suggests that the sentence is not merely stating facts but is colored by the viewpoint of the speaker or writer.\n\n3. **Emotional Tone**: The emotional tone of the sentence is negative, given the context of corruption, retribution, and illegal activities.\n\nInput:', "Evaluate the provided sentence to distinguish between verifiable facts and personal perspectives. Classify the sentence based on whether it conveys measurable, factual data or emotional, biased opinions, and then categorize it as either 'subjective' if it reflects personal opinions or 'objective' if it presents factual information.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases.

Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

The use of the phrase "in need of another couple of passes through the word processor" further emphasizes the personal opinion of the speaker, suggesting that the work is not yet polished to their satisfaction.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the film delivers what it promises : a look at the `` wild ride `` that ensues when brash young men set out to conquer the online world with laptops , cell phones and sketchy business plans .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: with a rare gift for melding subjectivity with biographical facts , m & # 225 ; rton brings sabina spielrein back to life , body and soul .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: devastated by her husband \'s death from a drug overdose , philippa ( played by cate blanchett ) , a british teacher living in turin , italy , tries to bring justice to the biggest drug dealer in turin when the local police ignore her information about him .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment and purpose of the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Sentiment**: The sentence expresses a negative sentiment due to the context of death and the frustration with the local police. However, the primary focus is on conveying a situation rather than expressing a personal opinion about the events.\n\n2. **Purpose**: The purpose of the sentence is to inform or describe a plot or situation, presumably from a movie or story, involving a character named Philippa and her actions following her husband\'s death.\n\n3. **Subjective vs. Objective**: The sentence is primarily **objective** because it describes a sequence of events or a situation without expressing a personal opinion or bias towards those events. Although it involves emotional content (e.g., "devastated"), this is used to set the context of the story rather than to persuade or express a personal viewpoint.\n\n4. **Classification**: Given that the sentence aims to describe a situation without promoting a personal opinion or bias, it can be categorized as **objective**.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the two friends devise a plan to dress up in drag , commit a minor felony , get caught and then sent to the same prison in order to retrievie the ticket .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: however after his son is witness to a killing he has done mike sullivan finds him self on the run trying to save the life of his son and at the same time looking for revenge on those who wronged him .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: because of his horribly unforgivable sins , freddy krueger ( robert englund ) is stuck in hell eternally .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Classify sentences into two distinct categories, \'subjective\' or \'objective\', by determining whether they convey personal opinions, emotions, or biases, or instead present verifiable, factual information, and then encapsulate your classification, either \'subjective\' for sentences with personal viewpoints or \'objective\' for those with quantifiable details, within <final_answer> tags to clearly denote the tone and intent of each given sentence.\n\nInput: disturbing for its unabashed honesty , our cast of characters both love and despise each other , their very actions acknowledging the pressures inherent in a tightly bonded peer group .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a comic tale about the end of the summer in ireland , 2001 , where 5 boys and 5 girls are out to end the summer with a bang before heading back to school to sit the final exams , only to be thwarted by comic mishappenings .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: just teetering south of puberty , young thomas harris has discovered that instead of looking at stars , he can use his new telescope to study the beautiful woman next door .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: shot on wide screen digibeta , sendak with his night kitchen theater partner , arthur yorinks and pilobolus artistic directors robby barnett , michael tracy , and jonathan wolken shows us the tenacity and wit that drive the creative process when serious artists work together .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "a passable romantic comedy , in need of another couple of passes through the word processor" can be classified as \'subjective\' because it expresses a personal opinion about the quality of a romantic comedy, using phrases like "passable" which implies a certain level of personal judgment or taste.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: a sentimental hybrid that could benefit from the spice of specificity .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence is expressing a personal viewpoint, as it uses phrases like "sentimental hybrid" and "spice of specificity," which convey a subjective evaluation or criticism.

Our goal is to differentiate between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that are influenced by personal opinions or emotional tones. To accomplish this, we must assess each sentence to establish whether it is grounded in concrete, evidence-based data or if it reflects individual beliefs, sentiments, or biases. The task requires labeling each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives, or objective, denoting a focus on verifiable, unbiased information. Your classification should be explicitly stated as 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> tags, allowing for clear identification of the sentence's nature, and thus facilitating a swift distinction between factually accurate, impartial sentences and those that convey personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the response formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for effortless recognition.

😶Generated Prompts: ['In this exercise, we aim to categorize sentences based on their tone and content, distinguishing between those that are subjective, which may include personal opinions, feelings, or biases, and those that are objective, which are grounded in factual, unbiased information. To achieve this, we will evaluate each sentence to determine if it presents a neutral, fact-based perspective or if it is colored by individual sentiments, emotions, or viewpoints. The task requires identifying whether a sentence is based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal beliefs or opinions. We need to label each sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal perspectives or emotional undertones, or objective, signifying a focus on impartial, evidence-based information. The goal is to separate sentences that convey personal opinions or emotional tones from those that are factually accurate and unbiased. Determine the nature of a given sentence by assessing whether it expresses a personal viewpoint, emotion, or opinion, making it subjective, or if it presents verifiable information, rendering it objective. Clearly classify the sentence as \'subjective\' or \'objective\' within the <final_answer> tags to facilitate a clear distinction between impartial, fact-based sentences and those that convey personal sentiments or biases, with the response formatted as <final_answer>\n\nInput: minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year \'s worst cinematic tragedies .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that \'s not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: he is haunted by the ghost of his deceased brother paul who guides him toward his salvation .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it \'s a bad , embarrassing movie .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about a movie, using words like "bad" and "embarrassing" to describe it.
