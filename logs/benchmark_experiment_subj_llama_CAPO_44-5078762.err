The term "genius" is particularly subjective, as it is an evaluation of someone\'s intellectual abilities or creativity.\n\n2. **"attempts to build a magnetic engine"** - This action is presented as a factual event within the context of the story. It describes what the character is doing without expressing a judgment about the feasibility, practicality, or morality of the action.\n\n3. **"in hopes of greatly reducing the world\'s consumption of fossil fuels and electricity"** - This part expresses a motivation or goal. The use of "in hopes" suggests an intention or desire, which is subjective, as it reflects the character\'s personal wishes or beliefs about what would be beneficial.\n\nConsidering these points, the sentence combines elements of objective description (the action of attempting to build a magnetic engine) with subjective interpretations (the characterization of the protagonist as a "troubled genius" and the expression of their hopes). However, the overall presentation is more aligned with subjective storytelling\n\nInput: weaves a spell over you , with its disturbingly close-up look at damaged psyches and its subtle undercurrents of danger . but its awkward structure keeps breaking the spell .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: moved in his heart with the urgency to reach out for christ , he gets an idea to try and reach the masses in his city for jesus .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: one of the greatest romantic comedies of the past decade .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: your night horrors start to bleed into your day job .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Your task is to evaluate the sentence and decide if it contains objective information (facts, measurable data) or subjective content (opinions, judgments, emotions).

The sentence also mentions not feeling much for the main character, which is an emotional response. Therefore, this sentence is subjective as it conveys personal sentiments and appraisals rather than providing factual, impartial data.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , \'what \'s the point ? \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: what they do n\'t know , however , is that they \'re filming near the secret hideout of slobodan pavle , a serbian war criminal .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Evaluate the sentiment of the provided sentence, distinguishing between statements that convey personal opinions and those that provide factual data, and categorize it accordingly as either subjective or objective, responding with the classification, either 'subjective' or 'objective', enclosed within <final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: susie resorts to these to become the most beautiful woman in the world .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: is this dead visitor all in keith 's head or is she truly a mother ghost ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: what they do n't know , however , is that they 're filming near the secret hideout of slobodan pavle , a serbian war criminal .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , 'what 's the point ?

It is factual and does not express any opinion or emotion.\n\n2. **"sendak with his night kitchen theater partner, arthur yorinks and pilobolus artistic directors robby barnett, michael tracy, and jonathan wolken"** - This segment introduces individuals involved in a project, likely a theatrical or dance production, given the mention of "night kitchen theater" and "pilobolus artistic directors." It provides names and roles, which are factual.\n\n3. **"shows us the tenacity and wit that drive the creative process when serious artists work together"** - This part of the sentence describes the outcome or the nature of the collaboration among these artists. The use of the words "tenacity" and "wit" to describe the creative process introduces a subjective interpretation. "Tenacity" and "wit" are positive attributes that reflect an opinion about the quality of the collaboration and the artists involved.\n\nGiven the analysis, the sentence combines\n\nInput: kung pow is oedekerk \'s realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` on guard ! `` wo n\'t be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world \'s best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, we need to identify whether it presents information in a neutral, factual manner or conveys personal views and emotions.\n\nThe sentence includes phrases such as "a whole lot of fun" and "have a whale of a good time," which indicate personal enjoyment and enthusiasm. Additionally, the statement "one of the world\'s best actors" is an opinion, as the ranking of actors can vary based on individual perspectives.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence conveys personal views and sentiments rather than presenting information in a purely neutral, factual manner.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life \'s stasis .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: tuck everlasting achieves a delicate balance of romantic innocence and philosophical depth .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: . . . works on some levels and is certainly worth seeing at least once .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after steve \'s job opportunity in san francisco falls through , he comes up with a plan .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence is subjective or objective, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"after steve \'s job opportunity in san francisco falls through"** - This part of the sentence provides a factual setup for the story. It states an event (a job opportunity falling through) without expressing a judgment or emotion about the event itself. However, the phrase "falls through" can slightly imply a negative outcome, but in the context of setting up a narrative, it\'s more about the event than an emotional judgment.\n\n2. **"he comes up with a plan"** - This part indicates an action taken by Steve as a response to the previous event. It\'s a factual statement about an action without expressing an opinion about the quality, feasibility, or emotional implications of the plan.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence primarily reports on events and actions without expressing a personal view or emotion about those events. It does not contain overt opinions, sentiments, or emotional language that would categorize it as subjective. Therefore, it presents information in a neutral, factual manner.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: he discovers that his daughter \'s life , unknown to him from an affair with a brazilian woman 15 years earlier , is in danger and must return to rio ; having only five days to finish the deal and find his daughter .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence describes a plot or situation involving a character who has a personal connection (a daughter from an affair) and is facing a time-sensitive challenge (finding his daughter and completing a deal within five days). The elements of danger, personal relationships, and urgency are typical of narrative structures found in fiction or personal stories.\n\n2. **Tone and Language**: The language used ("discovers," "life in danger," "must return") suggests a sense of urgency and importance, which is often indicative of a narrative designed to engage the reader or viewer emotionally. There\'s no overt emotional language (like "tragically" or "happily"), but the situation itself evokes a sense of tension or concern.\n\n3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: \n   - **Objective** information would typically be verifiable, factual, and not dependent on personal feelings, interpretations, or prejudices. It presents information as it is, without adding a personal perspective.\n   - **Subjective** information, on the other hand, involves personal opinions, feelings, or biases. It\'s about how someone perceives or interprets a situation, which can vary greatly from person to person\n\nInput:', 'Determine the tone of the given sentence: is it presenting verifiable evidence or conveying a personal viewpoint? Categorize the sentence as subjective, which encompasses emotions, personal opinions, and biased judgments, or as objective, which involves factual, unbiased information. Clearly indicate your classification result within the designated markers as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to signify whether the sentence is rooted in personal perspective or factual data.\n\nInput: a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone of the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"sam mendes"** - This is a proper noun, referring to a person. The mention of a specific individual does not inherently lean towards subjectivity or objectivity.\n2. **"has become valedictorian"** - This part of the sentence is factual. Becoming a valedictorian is an achievement based on academic performance, which can be verified through records.\n3. **"at the school for soft landings and easy ways out"** - This part introduces a subjective element. The name "school for soft landings and easy ways out" does not sound like a real or traditional academic institution. It implies a judgment or opinion about the nature of the school, suggesting it might not be challenging or rigorous.\n\nGiven the analysis, the sentence mixes factual information (becoming valedictorian) with a subjective judgment (the nature of the school). However, the primary subjective element is the description of the school, which conveys a personal viewpoint or bias rather than presenting verifiable evidence about the school\'s academic standards or reputation.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: brad , an art student hoping to win a prestigious fellowship , finds his life and career turned upside down when he falls for a faculty member at his college , lisa ducharme , who just happens to be his girlfriend \'s thesis adviser . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: kung pow is oedekerk \'s realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "kung pow is oedekerk \'s realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that" can be analyzed for its tone and content. The first part of the sentence states a fact about "kung pow" being a realization of Oedekerk\'s childhood dream, which could be considered objective information. However, the second part of the sentence, "and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that," introduces a judgment or opinion about the outcome of Oedekerk\'s dream. This judgment is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal viewpoint or opinion on the success or appropriateness of realizing childhood dreams.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence as a whole is conveying a personal viewpoint, especially with the phrase "should remain just that," which implies a value judgment on the part of the speaker. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it includes a personal opinion or biased judgment.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: not that any of us should be complaining when a film clocks in around 90 minutes these days , but the plotting here leaves a lot to be desired .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided expresses a personal viewpoint on the plotting of a film, indicating dissatisfaction and implying that the duration of the film, being around 90 minutes, is generally acceptable but not sufficient to redeem its plotting issues. The use of phrases like "leaves a lot to be desired" clearly conveys a subjective judgment rather than presenting factual, verifiable evidence. Therefore, the tone is subjective, reflecting the speaker\'s personal opinion or bias towards the film\'s plot.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: glib , satirical documentary that fudges facts , makes facile points and engages in the cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided contains words and phrases that indicate a personal viewpoint, such as "glib," "satirical," "fudges facts," "facile points," and "cinematic equivalent of tabloid journalism." These terms convey a negative opinion about the documentary in question, suggesting that it lacks depth, manipulates information, and employs sensationalist tactics. The use of such evaluative language indicates that the sentence is expressing a personal judgment rather than presenting neutral, factual information.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence is analyzing a storyline and the intentions of its creator, Shyamalan, and it includes phrases like "far bigger, far more meaningful story" which indicate a personal interpretation of the story\'s depth and significance. The use of words like "myriad signs" and the overall analysis provided suggest that the sentence is presenting a viewpoint rather than stating a fact. Therefore, the classification of the sentence is:\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

The given sentence expresses a personal opinion about the characters and plot of a movie, using words like "generic", "bland", which are subjective evaluations. The sentence also mentions not feeling much for the main character, which is an emotional response. Therefore, this sentence is subjective as it conveys personal sentiments and appraisals rather than providing factual, impartial data.

Using your understanding of subjectivity vs. objectivity in language, determine if the given sentence is objective (states facts, provides information without personal bias) or subjective (expresses opinions, emotions, or personal judgments). Place your classification between the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: a story about a troubled genius who attempts to build a magnetic engine in hopes of greatly reducing the worlds consumption of fossil fuels and electricity .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **"a story about a troubled genius"** - This part introduces a character with a subjective label ("troubled genius"), which implies a certain level of interpretation or judgment about the character's state or abilities. The term "genius" is particularly subjective, as it is an evaluation of someone's intellectual abilities or creativity.

2. **"attempts to build a magnetic engine"** - This action is presented as a factual event within the context of the story. It describes what the character is doing without expressing a judgment about the feasibility, practicality, or morality of the action.

3. **"in hopes of greatly reducing the world's consumption of fossil fuels and electricity"** - This part expresses a motivation or goal. The use of "in hopes" suggests an intention or desire, which is subjective, as it reflects the character's personal wishes or beliefs about what would be beneficial.

Considering these points, the sentence combines elements of objective description (the action of attempting to build a magnetic engine) with subjective interpretations (the characterization of the protagonist as a "troubled genius" and the expression of their hopes). However, the overall presentation is more aligned with subjective storytelling

( the amazing kreskin ) .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Assess the sentence to discern whether it conveys information in a neutral, fact-based manner that is open to verification, or if it embodies personal viewpoints, feelings, or biases that are inherently subjective. Make a judgment on whether the sentence relies on empirical evidence or individual perspective, and subsequently categorize it as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' by enclosing your classification between the <final_answer> </final_answer> markers, signifying whether the sentence communicates objective truth or personal opinion.\n\nInput: three different scenarios , intercut , all using the same words but with very different meanings .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence discusses "three different scenarios" that are "intercut" and use "the same words but with very different meanings." This description implies an analysis or observation about how the same words can have different meanings based on the context or scenario in which they are used.\n\n2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is descriptive and observational. It does not express a personal opinion or emotion directly but rather presents a situation or observation.\n\n3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: The statement can be seen as objective because it describes a phenomenon (the use of the same words in different scenarios with different meanings) that can be observed and verified. It does not express a personal viewpoint or bias but rather states a fact about language usage that can be empirically observed.\n\n4. **Empirical Evidence**: The phenomenon described can be supported by empirical evidence. For example, linguistic studies often examine how words\' meanings change based on context, and this can be demonstrated through numerous examples across languages.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is more aligned with objective observation than personal opinion, as it describes a verifiable aspect of language use without expressing a personal viewpoint.\n\n<final_answer>\n\nInput: impossible as it may sound , this film \'s heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided conveys a comparison and an evaluation of a film\'s portrayal of human behavior, suggesting that it is more embracing than another entity referred to as "monty." The key elements to analyze here are the phrases "impossible as it may sound," which introduces a subjective judgment, and "this film\'s heart is even more embracing," which directly expresses an opinion about the film\'s nature. Furthermore, the sentence states that the film "accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition," which, while it could be a factual description of the film\'s content, is framed within the context of a subjective evaluation of what makes the film\'s heart "more embracing."\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence embodies personal viewpoints and feelings about the film, comparing it to another entity ("monty") in a manner that is not strictly factual but rather interpretative. The use of words like "embracing" to describe the film\'s portrayal of human flaws indicates a value judgment that is subjective.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: an inept , tedious spoof of \'70s kung fu pictures , it contains almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch , and no more .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is an evaluation of a film, describing it as an "inept, tedious spoof of \'70s kung fu pictures" and stating it only has enough humor for a short sketch. This assessment is based on the critic\'s opinion of the film\'s quality and comedic value, using words like "inept" and "tedious" which convey a negative personal viewpoint. The use of "almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch, and no more" further emphasizes a subjective judgment on the film\'s ability to entertain. Since the statement reflects personal opinions and feelings about the film rather than presenting verifiable facts, it is not based on empirical evidence that can be universally verified. Therefore, the classification of the sentence is:\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Text categorization exercise: Examine the provided sentence to discern whether it conveys verifiable facts (objective) or embodies personal sentiments, emotions, or biases (subjective), and respond using the specified format: <final_answer>subjective or objective</final_answer>.\n\nInput:', 'Sentence classification challenge: Assess the tone and content of the given sentence to categorize it as either objective, conveying verifiable facts, or subjective, expressing personal sentiments or emotions.

🧟Generated 4 mutated prompts.
😶Generated Prompts: ['To accomplish this classification task, assess the given sentence to discern whether it presents information in a neutral, fact-based manner or if it embodies personal perspectives, sentiments, or biases. Your goal is to categorize the sentence as either objective, characterized by its factual and data-driven content, or subjective, marked by the presence of opinions, emotional undertones, or personal judgments. Upon evaluation, label the sentence with <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if it adheres to verifiable evidence and lacks personal inclination, or with <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if it reflects individual viewpoints, feelings, or speculative assertions.\n\nInput: gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the correspondence between spielrein , freud and jung discovered that day in the geneva basement has become essential to understanding the evolution of psychoanalysis ^ & # 214 ; and the virtually insurmountable challenges facing women who sought to contribute in any role other than that of patient .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components and tone:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence discusses historical figures (Spielrein, Freud, and Jung) and their correspondence, which is a factual, verifiable aspect of history. It also mentions the evolution of psychoanalysis and challenges faced by women, which are topics that can be supported by evidence.\n\n2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is informative and does not express a personal opinion or emotion regarding the individuals or the topic of psychoanalysis. The phrase "virtually insurmountable challenges" could be seen as slightly emotive, but in the context of historical fact, it\'s more descriptive of the obstacles faced by women rather than an expression of the author\'s sentiment.\n\n3. **Objectivity**: The sentence aims to inform about a historical discovery and its significance in understanding psychoanalysis and the challenges women faced in the field. It does not contain overt personal judgments, opinions, or biases that would categorize it as subjective.\n\n4. **Subjectivity**: While the sentence is generally factual, the description of challenges as "virtually insurmountable" introduces a slight subjective element, as it characterizes the degree of difficulty faced by women. However, this characterization\n\nInput: he has just graduated college , he has a beautiful girlfriend , jane , and a publisher has picked up his first novel .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this is the story of their lives , their memories , their unbending habits and the films they love .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: area k is an israeli controlled marine zone isolating the gaza strip and preventing palestinian fishermen from entering israel , egypt and international waters .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components and tone:\n\n1. **Factual Elements**: The sentence mentions "Area K," a specific geographical or administrative designation, and its role as an "Israeli controlled marine zone." This part of the sentence can be verified through factual records or official documents, indicating a level of objectivity.\n\n2. **Description of Function**: It describes Area K as isolating the Gaza Strip and preventing Palestinian fishermen from entering Israel, Egypt, and international waters. This description can be seen as factual, as it outlines the purpose or effect of the marine zone, which can be confirmed through reports, maps, or official statements.\n\n3. **Potential for Bias**: The sentence could be perceived as having a slight negative undertone towards Israel due to the use of the word "preventing," which might imply a restriction or a negative action. However, the primary focus of the sentence is on describing a situation rather than making a value judgment.\n\n4. **Lack of Emotional Language**: The sentence does not contain overtly emotional language or personal opinions. It sticks to describing a situation without using words that would clearly indicate a subjective viewpoint, such as "unjustly," "cruelly," or "wisely."\n\n5.\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the provided sentence to distinguish between verifiable data and personal opinions or emotions, then categorize it as either subjective or objective based on its content, and provide your assessment within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: these blow up another ship with jews , deports and jails the atlantic \'s refugees in palestine , and then deports them to far-off mauritius islands for 5 years in jail : until the end of the war .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>\nThe provided sentence contains a mix of historical events and emotional tone, making it subjective. The description of events such as blowing up a ship, deporting, and jailing refugees can be verified through historical records, which would be considered objective facts. However, the context and the way these events are presented, particularly the emphasis on "jews" and the overall negative portrayal, introduces a subjective perspective. The use of words like "blow up" and the focus on the treatment of specific groups can evoke emotions and suggests a personal opinion or bias against the actions described. Therefore, while the sentence includes verifiable historical data, its presentation and tone are subjective.\n</final_answer>\n\nInput: the transfer to the imax screen diminishes none of the film \'s drama , which was always much more about human emotions than technology .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call \'too clever by half . \'\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Classify the sentiment of the provided sentence as either subjective or objective and respond with the classification, either 'subjective' or 'objective', enclosed within <final_answer> tags for a concise answer.\n\nInput: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot .

This kind of language indicates a personal viewpoint that is critical and disapproving. The use of pejorative terms to describe the art suggests that the statement is influenced by the speaker\'s personal taste and emotions rather than a neutral, factual assessment. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it presents a personal opinion rather than verifiable information or facts.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: stephen stalls his interrogators with stories of his affair with toni , while she risks her freedom by seducing an employee in the d . a . \'s\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , \'what \'s the point ? \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: reinforces the often forgotten fact of the world \'s remarkably varying human population and mindset , and its capacity to heal using creative , natural and ancient antidotes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence presents a viewpoint that highlights the diversity of the human population and the potential for healing through creative, natural, and ancient methods. The use of phrases such as "often forgotten fact" and "capacity to heal" suggests a perspective that values and promotes these aspects. The tone is informative but also slightly promotional, indicating a personal viewpoint.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Evaluate the sentence to distinguish between verifiable data and personal perspectives, then categorize it as either objective, which presents information based on facts, or subjective, which conveys personal opinions or biases, and provide your assessment, either 'subjective' or 'objective', enclosed within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: though it pretends to expose the life of male hustlers , it 's exploitive without being insightful .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:", "Evaluate the provided sentence to distinguish between fact-based content and opinion-driven language, then provide a concise classification, either 'subjective' or 'objective', enclosed within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: a young novelist , tormented by his family 's history and haunted by the specter of his long-dead , more famous ancestor , falls in love with a woman , a distant relative of his ancestor , whose friends and family begin to disappear mysteriously .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: soon after , christin returns as a fierce ghost , and begins to kill all in her path at the hotel as a means for revenge .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: soon , annie 's condition helps leoncio 's children realize the essence of a family .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Assess the tone and intent of the given sentence to determine whether it expresses a personal viewpoint or presents information in a neutral, fact-based manner, and then categorize it accordingly as either subjective or objective, providing your assessment in the specified format, enclosing your chosen classification, either \'subjective\' or \'objective\', within <final_answer> tags: <final_answer>answer</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s plotless , shapeless -- and yet , it must be admitted , not entirely humorless . indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal viewpoint with the use of words like "must be admitted" and the description of the intensity of the humor as "almost dadaist proportions," which indicates a subjective interpretation of the subject\'s comedic value. The tone is also evaluative, using phrases like "plotless, shapeless" to describe the subject, which further suggests a personal opinion rather than a neutral, fact-based presentation of information. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it reflects the author\'s personal viewpoint and evaluation of the subject\'s humor and structure.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after steve \'s job opportunity in san francisco falls through , he comes up with a plan .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence describes a sequence of events involving a character named Steve and his job opportunity.

This kind of language suggests a strong personal opinion or bias rather than a neutral, fact-based presentation of information. The comparison to "truth or consequences" and the description of characters as "imbecilic mafia toolbags" further emphasize the subjective nature of the statement, as it reflects a personal viewpoint or judgment rather than an objective assessment. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as expressing a personal viewpoint rather than presenting information in a neutral manner.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: that such a horrible movie could have sprung from such a great one is one of the year \'s worst cinematic tragedies .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the given sentence is critical and disapproving, indicating a strong personal opinion about the movie in question. The use of the word "horrible" and "worst cinematic tragedies" emphasizes the negative sentiment and emotional judgment.

Evaluate the sentence to discern whether it conveys impartial, factual data that can be confirmed, or if it embodies personal sentiments, appraisals, or feelings that are prone to individual variation.

The given sentence expresses a personal opinion about the characters and plot of a movie, using words like "generic", "bland", which are subjective evaluations.

The given sentence expresses a strong negative opinion about a particular type of art, using words like "humorless", "drivel", and stating it was "made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention". This kind of language indicates a personal viewpoint that is critical and disapproving.

The tone seems somewhat informal and possibly narrative, setting up a story or scenario rather than presenting factual data.\n\n2. **Purpose**: The purpose appears to be introductory, setting the stage for a story or discussion about these characters, possibly exploring themes of friendship, racial dynamics, or personal interests. The sentence does not seem to aim at conveying statistical data or factual information about broader groups based on race or interests.\n\n3. **Bias and Perspective**: The choice of names ("blacky" for a white teen and "dumby" for an Aboriginal star) could be seen as biased or stereotypical, suggesting a subjective perspective. The description of "blacky" being more interested in books than sports and "dumby" being the star of the team might reinforce certain stereotypes, indicating a subjective viewpoint.\n\n4. **Sentiment Classification**: Given the narrative tone, the introduction of characters with potentially stereotypical descriptions, and the lack of factual data, the sentence leans towards being\n\nInput: enter nick , charlie \'s best friend , who does his best to help the only way he knows how : distracting charlie with parties and girls .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after steve \'s job opportunity in san francisco falls through , he comes up with a plan .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided reports on a sequence of events involving a character named Steve, without expressing a personal opinion or emotion towards the situation. It simply states that Steve\'s job opportunity fell through and that he then comes up with a plan, without any evaluative language that could suggest a biased perspective. The information given is neutral and does not include any personal feelings or opinions, focusing instead on a factual sequence of events. Therefore, the classification of the sentence\'s sentiment is:\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: writer-director stephen gaghan has made the near-fatal mistake of being what the english call \'too clever by half . \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided conveys a negative opinion about the writer-director Stephen Gaghan, using a phrase that implies he has overcomplicated things to his own detriment. The use of the phrase "near-fatal mistake" and "too clever by half" introduces a critical tone, suggesting that the speaker does not approve of Gaghan\'s approach. This kind of language is indicative of personal judgment rather than a neutral or factual report. Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is subjective, as it reflects the opinion or feeling of the speaker towards Gaghan\'s work.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: there \'s undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there \'s nothing else happening .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided expresses a personal opinion about films with movie references, stating that the enjoyment is "undeniable" but also limited, as it "wears thin" when there\'s no other substance. This evaluation of enjoyment and the impact of lacking content is based on personal feelings and opinions rather than factual data. Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is subjective, as it reflects the writer\'s personal view on the matter.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Examine the sentence to determine whether it conveys verifiable evidence or emotive perspectives, and then categorize it as either a factual report or a personal viewpoint, ultimately yielding a classification of \'subjective\' or \'objective\' that will be clearly indicated between the <final_answer> </final_answer> markers.\n\nInput: \'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a critical evaluation of a film, likely "chM-bteau," which seems to be a typographical error and possibly refers to a specific movie title. The use of words like "ludicrous," "contrived," and the phrase "cultural moat" indicates a strong opinion about the plot\'s credibility and the film\'s ability to transcend cultural barriers. This kind of language suggests that the statement is based on personal judgment rather than factual, empirical evidence. The criticism of the plot as "ludicrous and contrived" is a subjective interpretation that may vary from person to person, depending on individual tastes and cultural backgrounds.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: its purpose is to use the precog ( nitive ) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a beyond-lame satire , teddy bears \' picnic ranks among the most pitiful directing debuts by an esteemed writer-actor .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a negative opinion about a directing debut, using words like "beyond-lame", "pitiful", which are subjective and emotive. The language used is critical and disapproving, indicating a personal viewpoint rather than a factual report. The tone is also informal and evaluative, suggesting that the statement is based on personal taste rather than objective criteria.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: if you \'re part of her targeted audience , you \'ll cheer . otherwise , maybe .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a conditional reaction to someone\'s performance or action, which depends on the audience\'s relationship with the person in question. The use of "you\'ll cheer" and "otherwise, maybe" indicates a personal and variable response based on individual perspectives or feelings towards the person. This suggests that the sentence is conveying an emotive perspective rather than presenting verifiable evidence.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is best categorized as a personal viewpoint because it discusses potential reactions based on personal connections or feelings rather than providing factual information.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: dialogue-heavy and too cerebral for its own good -- or , at any rate , too cerebral for its racy subject matter .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about a particular subject, likely a movie or book, and its tone and content. The use of phrases such as "too cerebral for its own good" and "too cerebral for its racy subject matter" indicate a subjective evaluation of the subject\'s balance between intellectual depth and its provocative content. These judgments are based on personal taste and critical perspective rather than on verifiable facts.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: life , love , and the fear of failing . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: watching this film , one is left with the inescapable conclusion that hitchens \' obsession with kissinger is , at bottom , a sophisticated flower child \'s desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence is an analysis of Christopher Hitchens\' perspective on Henry Kissinger, but it is phrased in a way that conveys the opinion of the speaker rather than presenting verifiable evidence. The use of phrases such as "one is left with the inescapable conclusion" and "a sophisticated flower child\'s desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power" suggests a personal interpretation or viewpoint. The language used is emotive and interpretive, indicating that the statement is more of a subjective analysis than an objective report.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses an evaluation of the values that have helped the enterprise crew in their adventures, highlighting courage, self-sacrifice, and patience under pressure. This evaluation is based on the narrator\'s interpretation of the crew\'s behavior and the significance of these values, rather than on quantifiable data or empirical evidence. The use of words like "courage" and "self-sacrifice" implies a level of subjective judgment about what constitutes admirable or effective behavior under challenging circumstances.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is more aligned with a personal viewpoint, as it reflects an assessment or opinion about the crew\'s values and their impact, rather than presenting verifiable facts or data.

The given sentence expresses a strong negative opinion about a particular type of art, using words like "humorless", "drivel", and stating it was "made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention". This kind of language indicates a personal viewpoint that is critical and disapproving.

😶Generated Prompts: ["Our goal is to distinguish between sentences that convey factual, impartial information and those that embody personal feelings, opinions, or biases. To achieve this distinction, evaluate each sentence to ascertain whether it is rooted in tangible evidence and unbiased data or shaped by personal perspectives, and then categorize the sentiment of the given sentence as either subjective, reflecting personal views, or objective, based on verifiable facts. Provide your classification, clearly marked as either 'subjective' or 'objective', within the <final_answer> tags, to succinctly convey whether the sentence is subjective or objective, ensuring the response is formatted as <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for easy identification.\n\nInput: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it 's a bad , embarrassing movie .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: susie resorts to these to become the most beautiful woman in the world .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Examine the provided sentence to discern whether it conveys verifiable, unbiased data or embodies personal opinions, emotions, or assessments that are susceptible to personal perspectives. Assess whether the statement is grounded in empirical, quantifiable facts or influenced by individual perception, and subsequently label it as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: just teetering south of puberty , young thomas harris has discovered that instead of looking at stars , he can use his new telescope to study the beautiful woman next door .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, let\'s break it down into its components and analyze its nature:\n\n1. **Content Description**: The sentence describes a scene involving a young character, Thomas Harris, and his use of a telescope. It mentions his age relative to puberty and his choice of using the telescope to observe a neighbor rather than astronomical objects.\n\n2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is narrative and descriptive, setting a scene that could be part of a story. The tone seems to be observational and slightly humorous, given the unexpected use of the telescope.\n\n3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: \n   - **Objective** statements are typically based on verifiable evidence, quantifiable data, and are less likely to change based on the observer\'s perspective. They aim to report facts without personal bias.\n   - **Subjective** statements, on the other hand, reflect personal opinions, feelings, or biases. They can vary greatly from person to person and are often influenced by individual experiences, emotions, and perspectives.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence "just teetering south of puberty, young Thomas Harris has discovered that instead of looking at stars, he can use his new telescope to study the beautiful woman next door" is more aligned with\n\nInput: the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it \'s begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a negative opinion about the Merchant-Ivory team and their impact on cinema. The use of strong language such as "systematically destroy" and "do even more damage" indicates a personal assessment rather than a neutral, factual report. The statement reflects the speaker\'s emotional perspective and subjective evaluation of the team\'s work, rather than presenting verifiable, empirical data.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the pain , loneliness and insecurity of the screenwriting process are vividly and painfully brought to slovenly life in this self-deprecating , biting and witty feature written by charlie kaufman and his twin brother , donald , and directed by spike jonze .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: naxalites are becoming more and more popular among tribles because of their capacity to give instant justice and more and more youths are joining them .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **"Naxalites are becoming more and more popular among tribles"** - This part of the statement could be considered subjective because the term "popular" can be perceived differently by various individuals. Popularity can be measured in various ways, including the number of supporters, the level of influence, or the frequency of positive mentions in media or community discussions. However, without specific, quantifiable data, the claim of increasing popularity remains subjective.\n\n2. **"because of their capacity to give instant justice"** - This reason provided for the Naxalites\' popularity introduces a subjective judgment. The concept of "instant justice" can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives and values. What one person considers justice, another might not. This part of the statement reflects a value judgment rather than an objective fact.\n\n3. **"and more and more youths are joining them"** - Similar to the first part, the claim that "more and more youths are joining them" could be subjective without concrete, empirical evidence. It implies an increase in membership among youths, but without specific numbers or data, it\'s difficult to verify the extent of this trend.\n\nGiven these considerations, the statement\n\nInput: is this dead visitor all in keith \'s head or is she truly a mother ghost ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the given sentence to determine whether it presents factual information or expresses personal viewpoints. Your goal is to categorize the sentence as either objective, which includes verifiable evidence or quantifiable observations, or subjective, which encompasses personal beliefs, sentiments, or biases. Clearly label the sentence as \'subjective\' or \'objective\' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> markers to indicate its nature.\n\nInput: humorless , self-conscious art drivel , made without a glimmer of intelligence or invention .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: grace \'s only salvation appears to be by the guidance of her paternal grandfather reverend salo sr . ( the amazing kreskin ) .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a young novelist , tormented by his family \'s history and haunted by the specter of his long-dead , more famous ancestor , falls in love with a woman , a distant relative of his ancestor , whose friends and family begin to disappear mysteriously .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: in old-fashioned screenwriting parlance , ms . shreve \'s novel proved too difficult a text to \'lick , \' despite the efforts of a first-rate cast .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: naxalites are becoming more and more popular among tribles because of their capacity to give instant justice and more and more youths are joining them .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life \'s stasis .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the film contains colour home movie footage of the film \'s production which where shot by charles \' brother sydney .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence discusses a specific film and its content, mentioning "colour home movie footage" of the film\'s production.\n2. **Source of Information**: It specifies that the footage was shot by "Charles\' brother Sydney," providing a clear origin for the footage.\n3. **Nature of the Statement**: The statement reports on a factual aspect of the film, detailing its content and the source of the footage.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence is reporting on verifiable information about the film\'s content and production. It does not express a personal opinion, sentiment, or bias towards the film or its production quality. Therefore, it is categorized as objective because it provides quantifiable observations about the film.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Evaluate the sentence to distinguish between verifiable data and personal perspectives, then categorize it as either objective, which presents information based on facts, or subjective, which conveys personal opinions or biases, and provide your assessment, either 'subjective' or 'objective', enclosed within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput:"]
