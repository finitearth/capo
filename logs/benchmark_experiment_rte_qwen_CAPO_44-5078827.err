😶Generated Prompts: ['For this task on natural language inference, you\'ll be given pairs of sentences. Your job is to assess whether the meaning of the second sentence can be logically concluded from the first. In other words, decide if a sensible person would deduce the second sentence based on the information in the first. Indicate your conclusion by classifying each pair as either Entailment (if the second sentence logically follows from the first) or no entailment (if the second sentence doesn\'t necessarily follow from the first). Please wrap your classification in <final_answer>answer</final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: Text 1:\nON 29 June the Dutch right-wing coalition government collapsed.

Its nearest rival, the Democratic Alliance, has 16%, while ANC splinter-group the Congress of the People trails with 8%.  The results will see ANC leader Jacob Zuma elected as President of South Africa when the National Assembly reconvenes in May.  Provincial elections are also being held, and the ANC looks likely to lose power in the province of Western Cape to the Democratic Alliance. This will be the first time an opposition party has won control of a provincial parliament since the end of apartheid.  The election campaign has focused on crime, poverty, and the suitability of Zuma to be President. Zuma was acquitted of rape in 2006, and corruption charges against him were withdrawn shortly before the election after prosecutors found the charges had been politically motivated.\n Text 2:\nJacob Zuma is the leader of the ANC party.\nOutput: <final_answer>Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nIf no settlement is reached, a divided Cyprus will join the European Union on May 1, 2004.\n Text 2:\nCyprus was divided into two parts on May 1, 2004.\nOutput: <final_answer>No Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nTom Cruise has returned to The Oprah Winfrey Show and talked about his love for Katie Holmes, but this time he was denying marital problems instead of jumping on the couch to prove his passion for the young actress.

But all this provides little reason to hope that Mexico has really turned a corner in its efforts to control the illegal drug trade.

In this task focused on natural language inference, you will analyze each given pair of sentences. Your goal is to decide if the second sentence's meaning can be logically deduced from the first, meaning that one could reasonably infer the second sentence from the information in the first. Indicate your conclusion by classifying each pair as either Entailment (if the second sentence logically follows from the first) or no entailment (if the second sentence does not necessarily follow from the first). Please encapsulate your classification within <final_answer>answer</final_answer> tags.

The publishing of a series of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a Copenhagen newspaper sparked a string of harsh and in some places violent reactions in the Middle East, forcing European leaders to try to calm the situation. This backlash started in late September 2005, when the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published a dozen cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad. The images ranged from serious to comical in nature; a particularly controversial cartoon portrays Mohammad with a bomb wrapped in his turban. The Jutland-based newspaper states that the images were meant to inspire some level of public debate over the image of Islam in Europe, and had no direct aim of offending anyone.
 Text 2:
Jyllands-Posten is published in Copenhagen.

😶Generated Prompts: ['In this exercise centered around natural language understanding, you will analyze each given pair of sentences. Your objective is to determine if the second sentence (Sentence B) can be logically concluded from the first sentence (Sentence A). Carefully examine the semantic connection between the sentences to decide if Sentence B can be inferred from Sentence A. Your task is to assess whether the content of the first sentence provides enough support for the second sentence to be reasonably inferred. Categorize each pair as Entailment (if Sentence B logically follows from Sentence A) or no entailment (if Sentence B does not necessarily follow from Sentence A). Please wrap your classification in <final_answer>answer</final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: Text 1:\n"Bless Me, Ultima" has survived a challenge in New York without being banned, or indeed, burned.

NASA tested an experimental tile under the Discovery\'s left wing during its approach for landing. The tile was almost eight centimetres thick, and had a bump in it, intended to disturb the otherwise smooth airflow over the shuttle\'s wing, thus exposing it to high amounts of heat. Engineers installed the tile in order to measure the excess heat that was generated on downstream tiles. A military airplane monitored the heat with an infrared camera.

Unfortunately for them, Kevin Garnett was holding the extinguisher when the Suns came into the Target Center on Monday night. Garnett posted a double-double, scoring 44 points and snaring 11 rebounds, as the Minnesota Timberwolves defeated the Phoenix Suns 121-112. The loss prevented the Suns from posting a perfect record in the month of January, and ended the Suns\' season-high 17-game winning streak. The Suns had problems answering Garnett\'s scoring prowess, but it was the Minnesota defense that doomed the Suns, limiting them to 17 points in the final quarter after allowing 95 from Phoenix in the first three periods. Steve Nash had 20 points and 18 assists, but in the fourth quarter he was only able to score 3 points and provide one assist.\n Text 2:\nKevin Garnett was born in Minnesota.\nOutput: <final_answer>No Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nThe Tunisian Foreign Ministry announced that Libyan leader Colonel Moammar Al Kaddafy arrived in Tunis this morning, Monday, for a "brotherly and recreational" visit, at the invitation of Tunisian President Zine El Abidine Bin Ali.\n Text 2:\nLibya\'s leader Colonel Muammar Qaddafi arrived in Tunisia at the invitation of President Zine El Abidine Bin Ali.\nOutput: <final_answer>Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nBowles will take the title HRH Duchess of Cornwall, changing it to the Princess Consort, when Charles becomes King.\n Text 2:\nBowles will be known as HRH Duchess of Cornwall.\nOutput: <final_answer>Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nWasp and bee stings can be life threatening if you are allergic to the venom.\n Text 2:\nbee stings can be fatal\nOutput: <final_answer>Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nSeagate Technology has said it intends to buy rival company Maxtor for $1.9 billion.

He's appointed new people to key military and criminal justice positions, deployed troops to quell drug violence, reasserted federal police power, extradited a few major traffickers to the United States, and given a green light to legislation clarifying Mexico's drug laws. But all this provides little reason to hope that Mexico has really turned a corner in its efforts to control the illegal drug trade. For a guide to what's in store, one need only look at past sexenios (the six year terms of Mexican presidents).\n Text 2:\nFelipe Calderon is the President of Mexico.\nOutput: <final_answer>Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nThe Walt Disney Co. donated one of the world's most significant private collections of African artwork, yesterday, to the Smithsonian's National Museum of African Art.\n Text 2:\nDisney gave the Smithsonian a trove of sought-after African art.\nOutput: <final_answer>Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'In this linguistic reasoning game and natural language comprehension test, you\'ll examine pairs of sentences to uncover their semantic connection.

Its nearest rival, the Democratic Alliance, has 16%, while ANC splinter-group the Congress of the People trails with 8%.  The results will see ANC leader Jacob Zuma elected as President of South Africa when the National Assembly reconvenes in May.  Provincial elections are also being held, and the ANC looks likely to lose power in the province of Western Cape to the Democratic Alliance. This will be the first time an opposition party has won control of a provincial parliament since the end of apartheid.  The election campaign has focused on crime, poverty, and the suitability of Zuma to be President. Zuma was acquitted of rape in 2006, and corruption charges against him were withdrawn shortly before the election after prosecutors found the charges had been politically motivated.\n Text 2:\nJacob Zuma is the leader of the ANC party.\nOutput: <final_answer>Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nThe publishing of a series of cartoons of the Prophet Mohammad in a Copenhagen newspaper sparked a string of harsh and in some places violent reactions in the Middle East, forcing European leaders to try to calm the situation. This backlash started in late September 2005, when the Danish newspaper Jyllands-Posten published a dozen cartoons depicting the Prophet Mohammad. The images ranged from serious to comical in nature; a particularly controversial cartoon portrays Mohammad with a bomb wrapped in his turban. The Jutland-based newspaper states that the images were meant to inspire some level of public debate over the image of Islam in Europe, and had no direct aim of offending anyone.\n Text 2:\nJyllands-Posten is published in Copenhagen.\nOutput: <final_answer>Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nThe M-2000 uses a commercially manufactured NbTi superconductor, similar to that used in the M-2000 Maglev magnets.\n Text 2:\nMaglev is commercially used.\nOutput: <final_answer>No Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nMedicare will select by lottery 10 percent of those who apply by Aug. 16 to begin receiving benefits starting Sept. 1.\n Text 2:\nMedicare will choose 10 percent of applicants to receive benefits by Aug. 16.\nOutput: <final_answer>No Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nAs the U.S. military evacuated Saigon in the Spring of 1975, President Gerald Ford approved Operation Babylift, the plan to transport thousands of Vietnamese children to adoptive parents in the West, hundreds of them at a time, before the U.S. was forced out of the country.\n Text 2:\nThe U.S. military evacuated U.S. citizens.\nOutput: <final_answer>No Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nWASHINGTON - On the mornings he is in town, Dick Cheney wakes up at 6, climbs into his black sport utility vehicle and drives himself to a Starbucks near his McLean, Va., home. He returns with a pair of grande skim lattes — decaf for him, regular for his wife, Lynne — and settles into work in the sun-drenched office above his garage, penning his memoir in longhand on yellow legal pads.
