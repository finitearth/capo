It states that four individuals are having trouble with something unspecified and that Steve has received a job offer in San Francisco. These are statements that can be verified and do not express opinions or feelings.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Assess whether the given sentence conveys objective facts that can be verified or subjective opinions, emotions, and judgments.

For example, "stark portrait," "motherhood deferred," and "desire explored" are subjective expressions that convey the author\'s interpretation or feelings about the subject matter. These phrases are not verifiable facts but rather subjective descriptions of the narrative\'s themes and atmosphere.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Your mission is to assess the given sentence and categorize it as either 'subjective' (expressing personal opinions, feelings, or assessments) or 'objective' (stating facts that are verifiable and free from personal bias).
