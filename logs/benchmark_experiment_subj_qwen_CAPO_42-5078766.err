These are statements that can be verified and do not express opinions or feelings.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Assess whether the given sentence conveys objective facts that can be verified or subjective opinions, emotions, and judgments.

Based on your knowledge of the differences between subjective and objective language, analyze the given sentence and determine if it is 'subjective' (expressing opinions, feelings, or judgments) or 'objective' (stating facts that are verifiable and free from personal bias). Please insert your determination between the <final_answer>your determination</final_answer> markers.

Input: peralta 's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "Peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed, adult hindsight."

- The sentence includes the phrase "could have used," which implies a judgment or opinion about what might have improved the subject's work.
- "Mythmaking" is a term that can be subjective, as it suggests the creation of stories or narratives that may not be entirely factual.
- "Informed, adult hindsight" is a subjective phrase, as it implies a personal view on what constitutes "informed" and "adult" perspectives.

Given these elements, the sentence expresses opinions and judgments rather than stating verifiable facts.

Input: land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence provided:

"land, people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored."

This sentence contains terms and phrases that express feelings, judgments, or opinions rather than stating verifiable facts. For example, "stark portrait," "motherhood deferred," and "desire explored" are subjective expressions that convey the author's interpretation or feelings about the subject matter. These phrases are not verifiable facts but rather subjective descriptions of the narrative's themes and atmosphere.

"The advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap. Any rock pile will do for a set."\n   - This sentence presents a viewpoint that a postapocalyptic setting is cost-effective and that simple sets can be used. While the cost-effectiveness might be a fact, the statement that "any rock pile will do" is a subjective assessment of what is sufficient for a set, which can vary based on individual standards and preferences.\n   - Classification: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\n2. "Reign of Fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap."\n   - This sentence expresses a subjective opinion about the appearance of the movie "Reign of Fire."

"this re-do is so dumb" - This part of the sentence expresses a personal opinion about the quality of the re-do, which is subjective.\n2. "so exploitative in its violence" - This part also conveys a subjective judgment about the nature of the violence in the re-do.\n3. "ironically, it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against" - This part includes a subjective assessment of the original work as "clumsy" and a subjective interpretation of what the original was "railing against."\n\nGiven that the sentence contains multiple subjective judgments and personal opinions, it cannot be classified as an objective fact.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Your assignment is to analyze the given sentence and categorize it as either 'subjective' (indicating personal opinions, emotions, or judgments) or 'objective' (presenting factual information without personal bias).

The dataset comprises sentences that are marked as either subjective or objective. Your job is to sort each sentence into one of these categories. Identify whether the sentence is 'subjective', which means it includes opinions, emotions, or judgments, or 'objective', which means it is based on facts and free from personal bias.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

The dataset comprises sentences that are marked as either subjective or objective. Your job is to sort each sentence into one of these categories. Identify whether the sentence is 'subjective', which means it includes opinions, emotions, or judgments, or 'objective', which means it is based on facts and free from personal bias.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

The dataset comprises sentences that are marked as either subjective or objective. Your job is to sort each sentence into one of these categories. Identify whether the sentence is 'subjective', which means it includes opinions, emotions, or judgments, or 'objective', which means it is based on facts and free from personal bias. Make sure to wrap your final decision with these tags: <final_answer>your classification here</final_answer>.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

The dataset comprises sentences that are marked as either subjective or objective. Your job is to sort each sentence into one of these categories. Identify whether the sentence is 'subjective', which means it includes opinions, emotions, or judgments, or 'objective', which means it is based on facts and free from personal bias. Make sure to wrap your final decision with these tags: <final_answer>your classification here</final_answer>.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

The dataset comprises sentences that are marked as either subjective or objective. Your job is to sort each sentence into one of these categories. Identify whether the sentence is 'subjective', which means it includes opinions, emotions, or judgments, or 'objective', which means it is based on facts and free from personal bias. Make sure to wrap your final decision with these tags: <final_answer>your classification here</final_answer>.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

The dataset comprises sentences that are marked as either subjective or objective. Your job is to sort each sentence into one of these categories. Identify whether the sentence is 'subjective', which means it includes opinions, emotions, or judgments, or 'objective', which means it is based on facts and free from personal bias. Make sure to wrap your final decision with these tags: <final_answer>your classification here</final_answer>.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Your goal is to categorize each sentence as either \'objective\' or \'subjective\', indicating whether it provides unbiased, verifiable information or includes personal opinions, emotions, or assessments. Please format your classification as follows: <final_answer>your_classification</final_answer>.\n\nInput: barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence: "Barney has created a tour de force that is weird, wacky and wonderful."\n\n- "Barney has created a tour de force" - This part of the sentence could be considered objective if it can be verified that Barney indeed created something that qualifies as a tour de force (a work that shows off a creator\'s greatest abilities). However, the term "tour de force" itself can be subjective as it depends on the perception of the audience or critics.\n\n- "weird, wacky and wonderful" - These are subjective descriptors. The terms "weird," "wacky," and "wonderful" are based on personal feelings and opinions. What one person finds weird or wonderful, another might not.\n\nGiven that the sentence includes subjective descriptors and the term "tour de force" can also be subjective, the overall classification of the sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Thoroughly analyze each sentence to determine if it conveys an objective fact, which is a statement that can be verified as true or false, or a subjective opinion, which reflects a personal viewpoint that can differ among individuals. Utilize your knowledge of subjective and objective language to label each sentence as either \'objective\' for statements presented in a neutral, unbiased way, or \'subjective\' for those that express personal feelings, judgments, or evaluations. Please wrap your classification in this format: <final_answer>your_classification</final_answer>.\n\nInput: however , soon they have the cops and the anti-terror corps on their tails .\nOutput: user\nThe sentence "however, soon they have the cops and the anti-terror corps on their tails" describes a situation where law enforcement and anti-terror units are pursuing someone. This statement can be verified as true or false based on the occurrence of the described events. It does not express a personal viewpoint, feeling, or evaluation. \n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they \'re each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze each sentence:\n\n1. "You have to pay attention to follow all the stories, but they\'re each interesting."\n   - This sentence contains both objective and subjective elements. The part "You have to pay attention to follow all the stories" is objective as it describes a requirement for understanding the plot. However, "they\'re each interesting" is subjective because the perception of interest can vary from person to person.\n   - Classification: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\n2. "The movie is well shot and very tragic, and one to ponder after the credits roll."\n   - "The movie is well shot" can be considered objective as it refers to the technical quality of the film, which can be evaluated based on cinematography standards. However, "very tragic" and "one to ponder after the credits roll" are subjective as they express personal feelings and judgments about the emotional impact and the depth of the movie\'s themes.\n   - Classification: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nIn summary, both sentences contain subjective elements and are therefore classified as subjective.\n\nInput: dennis clegg is in his thirties and lives in a halfway house for the mentally ill in london .\nOutput: user\nTo determine if the given sentence is objective or subjective, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. "Dennis Clegg is in his thirties" - This is a factual statement that can be verified by checking Dennis Clegg\'s age. It is objective.\n2. "lives in a halfway house for the mentally ill in London" - This is also a factual statement that can be verified by checking Dennis Clegg\'s residence and the nature of the facility. It is objective.\n\nSince both parts of the sentence are factual and can be verified, the entire sentence is an objective statement.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: firefighter gordon brewer is plunged into the complex and dangerous world of international terrorism after he loses his wife and child in a bombing credited to claudio `` the wolf `` perrini .\nOutput: user\nThis sentence is describing a fictional scenario, likely from a plot summary or a book description. It includes specific details such as the name of the character (firefighter Gordon Brewer), the event (losing his wife and child in a bombing), and the perpetrator (Claudio "The Wolf" Perrini). These details are presented in a way that describes the events and the characters involved without expressing personal feelings or judgments. Therefore, the sentence is stating facts about the fictional scenario, even though the scenario itself is not real.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: police and investigators believed the murders were in retaliation for a robbery days prior to the murders .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: an absurd comedy about a parking enforcement officer , who - despite constant abuse from the public - finds truth , honour and serenity in the act of ticketing .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: are the experiences of the main character profound , or simply routine ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Make sure to wrap your final decision with these tags: <final_answer>your classification here</final_answer>.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

The dataset comprises sentences that are marked as either subjective or objective. Your job is to sort each sentence into one of these categories. Identify whether the sentence is 'subjective', which means it includes opinions, emotions, or judgments, or 'objective', which means it is based on facts and free from personal bias. Make sure to wrap your final decision with these tags: <final_answer>your classification here</final_answer>.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

The sentence discusses a "romance" and a "world" described as "impossible." This is a description of a narrative or a story, which is inherently subjective as it involves interpretation and personal perspective.\n\n2. The phrase "dare us to say why either is impossible" suggests a challenge to the reader\'s beliefs or perceptions, which is a subjective statement as it involves personal opinions and feelings.\n\n3. The sentence concludes with "forces us to confront what\'s possible and what we might do to make it so," which is a subjective statement as it involves personal beliefs about what is possible and what actions might be taken.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence is clearly expressing opinions and interpretations rather than presenting factual information without personal bias. Therefore, the sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .\nOutput: user\nThe provided sentence is clearly subjective. It conveys personal opinions and judgments about the comedy, describing it as "incredibly irritating" and about "thoroughly vacuous people." Additionally, it criticizes the film for embodying "the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy," which are subjective assessments rather than objective facts.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: smart , sassy interpretation of the oscar wilde play .\nOutput: user\nThe sentence "smart, sassy interpretation of the Oscar Wilde play" is subjective because it conveys personal opinions and assessments about the interpretation of the play.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

😶Generated Prompts: ["The dataset includes sentences tagged as either subjective or objective. Your task involves categorizing each sentence as either subjective or objective based on its content. Determine if the sentence presents an objective fact, which is a statement that can be proven true or false without personal bias, or a subjective opinion, which reflects personal feelings, judgments, or perspectives. Your classification should indicate whether the sentence is 'subjective', meaning it expresses personal views or emotions, or 'objective', meaning it is fact-based and unbiased. Please format your response as follows: <final_answer>your_classification</final_answer>.\n\nInput: a london website designer ops out of her comfortable but ordinary relationship with a nice boyfriend when she forms a dangerously obsessive bond with a handsome , mysterious mountaineer , who turns out to have some secrets .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: but cousin roberto is n't the tough guy they 'd expected .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: first kammy meets the 40-year-old danny ( dave wong ) and falls head over heels .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after an attempt is made on his life by unknown gunmen , whom he kills them all using martal arts skills he did n't know he had , he learns that all of his dreams of a past life are real and that for the past three years he was raised by the couple after finding him in a river , half-dead with five bullet wounds in him .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: when she fails to find the `` perfect man `` that will make her happy , she decides to construct him herself , using parts from different people .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Thoroughly analyze each sentence to determine whether it presents an objective fact, which is a verifiable statement free from personal bias, or a subjective perspective, which is a personal opinion, emotion, or assessment that can vary from person to person. Use your understanding of the distinctions between subjective and objective language to label the sentence as \'subjective\' for personal opinions or feelings, or \'objective\' for factual statements without personal bias. Please wrap your classification in the <final_answer>your_classification</final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: lieutenant hart must then defend the black pilot against charges before an obviously racist american tribunal ; unaware that the trial itself is only a front for the real secret of the prison camp .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence provided:\n\n"hardly a masterpiece, but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people."\n\n1. "hardly a masterpiece" - This part of the sentence is subjective. It expresses a personal opinion about the quality of something, likely a film or a piece of art, and the term "masterpiece" is subjective as it can vary from person to person.\n\n2. "it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise" - The phrase "good charitable enterprise" is subjective. The term "good" is a value judgment and can vary based on personal opinions and beliefs.\n\n3. "and some interesting real people" - The term "interesting" is subjective, as what is considered interesting can vary from person to person.\n\nGiven that the sentence contains subjective terms and personal opinions, it cannot be classified as an objective fact.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: imamura \'s delight in the infinite oddity of men and women is goofy ; it \'s also , at heart , reverent .\nOutput: user\nThis sentence expresses Imamura\'s feelings and the author\'s interpretation of those feelings, which includes the use of subjective terms like "goofy" and "reverent." These are not verifiable facts but rather personal assessments and opinions. Therefore, the sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence: "The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed."\n\nThe sentence contains an evaluation of the quality and style of the dialogue, specifically describing it as "choppy" and "monosyllabic." These descriptors are subjective because they are based on personal perception and can vary from one person to another. The term "very" also intensifies the subjective nature of the statement, as it reflects a personal judgment about the degree to which the dialogue is choppy and monosyllabic.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is expressing a subjective perspective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Thoroughly analyze each sentence to determine if it conveys an objective fact, which is a statement that can be verified as true or false, or a subjective opinion, which reflects a personal viewpoint that can differ among individuals. Utilize your knowledge of subjective and objective language to label each sentence as either \'objective\' for statements presented in a neutral, unbiased way, or \'subjective\' for those that express personal feelings, judgments, or evaluations. Please wrap your classification in this format: <final_answer>your_classification</final_answer>.\n\nInput: ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer \'s memory .\nOutput: user \'<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\'\n\nInput: despite the 2-d animation , the wild thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence: "Despite the 2-d animation, the Wild Thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience."\n\n1. "Despite the 2-d animation" - This part of the sentence is objective as it describes a factual aspect of the movie, specifically that it uses 2-dimensional animation.\n\n2. "the Wild Thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience" - This part is subjective. The term "cinematic experience" is a personal evaluation and the use of "surprisingly" indicates a personal reaction or judgment.\n\nSince the sentence includes a subjective evaluation, the overall classification of the sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: thekids will probably stay amused at the kaleidoscope of big , colorful characters . mom and dad can catch some quality naptime along the way .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer> Subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Examine each sentence carefully to ascertain whether it presents an objective fact (a statement that can be proven true or false without personal bias) or a subjective opinion (a personal perspective that may vary from person to person).

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

😶Generated Prompts: ['The dataset includes sentences that are categorized as either subjective or objective. Your task is to determine the classification of each sentence. Carefully examine each sentence to decide if it conveys an objective fact, which is a statement that can be proven true or false, or a subjective opinion, which reflects a personal perspective that can differ from person to person. Your goal is to identify whether the sentence is \'subjective\', indicating it contains personal opinions, emotions, or judgments, or \'objective\', meaning it is based on verifiable facts and is free from personal bias. Utilize your understanding of subjective and objective language to label each sentence as \'objective\' if it is presented in a neutral, unbiased way, or \'subjective\' if it expresses personal feelings, judgments, or evaluations.

"windtalkers is shapelessly gratifying" - This part expresses an opinion about the movie, using words like "shapelessly" and "gratifying," which are subjective terms.\n2. "the kind of movie that invites you to pick apart its faults" - This is a subjective statement as it involves a personal judgment about the movie\'s quality.\n3. "even as you have to admit that somehow it hit you where you live" - This phrase is highly subjective, as it involves personal feelings and reactions to the movie.\n\nGiven that the sentence contains personal opinions, feelings, and assessments, it is clear that the sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the lizard , chaos , scar , heartless and sic inhabit the violent and often bizarre world of backyard wrestling .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: blueberry is stationed in the little town of palomito as sheriff .\nOutput: user\nTo determine whether the sentence "blueberry is stationed in the little town of palomito as sheriff." is subjective or objective, let\'s break it down:\n\n1.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

It is a straightforward assertion about a person\'s position and location.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sentence is presenting an objective fact.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that , ironically , it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'The dataset includes sentences that are categorized as either subjective or objective. Your task is to classify each sentence into one of these two categories. Determine if the sentence is \'subjective\', meaning it conveys opinions, emotions, or personal judgments, or \'objective\', meaning it presents facts without personal bias. Using your understanding of subjective and objective language, examine the given sentence and decide if it is \'subjective\' (expressing opinions, feelings, or judgments) or \'objective\' (stating facts without personal bias). Ensure you encapsulate your final determination with these tags: <final_answer>your classification here</final_answer>.\n\nInput: two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: just on the other side of thirty , dave is an unemployed sculptor clumsily going nowhere in a small town .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: as fran \'s requests become more peculiar , chep is thrown into increasingly bizarre situations .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .\nOutput: user\nThe sentence "barney has created a tour de force that is weird, wacky and wonderful." is subjective because it includes personal judgments and opinions about Barney\'s creation, using words like "weird," "wacky," and "wonderful," which are subjective descriptors.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: when she fails to find the `` perfect man `` that will make her happy , she decides to construct him herself , using parts from different people .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: suffering from his flashbacks , vince does n\'t realize that ellen has also disappeared from the cemetery , right before his eyes .\nOutput: user\nTo determine whether the sentence is subjective or objective, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. "Suffering from his flashbacks, Vince doesn\'t realize that Ellen has also disappeared from the cemetery, right before his eyes."\n   - This sentence describes a scenario where Vince is experiencing flashbacks and fails to notice Ellen\'s disappearance.\n   - The sentence provides a factual account of what is happening to the characters, without expressing personal opinions or emotions.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sentence is presenting a scenario without personal bias or opinion. Therefore, it is:\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>.\n\nInput:', 'Analyze each sentence to decide if it conveys an objective fact, which is a statement that can be verified as true or false without any personal bias, or a subjective opinion, which involves personal feelings, judgments, or assessments that may vary among individuals. Your task is to categorize each sentence as either \'subjective\', indicating it includes opinions, emotions, or judgments, or \'objective\', meaning it is based on verifiable facts and is free from personal bias. Use your knowledge of subjective and objective language to assign the correct label to each sentence. Please encapsulate your classification in the following format: <final_answer>your_classification</final_answer>.\n\nInput: he falls for hunky diner owner matt , who falls just as hard back .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: day in , day out , the same routine is repeated .\nOutput: user\nTo determine whether the sentence "day in, day out, the same routine is repeated" is objective or subjective, we need to consider if it can be verified as true or false without personal bias.\n\nThe sentence describes a repetitive action ("the same routine is repeated") that occurs consistently ("day in, day out"). This statement can be observed and verified by someone who is aware of the routine and can confirm its repetition over time. It does not include personal feelings, judgments, or assessments that may vary among individuals.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is an objective fact.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he \'s finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst .\nOutput: user\nThis sentence contains a mix of objective and subjective elements. The part about Peter Bogdanovich taking a long time to provide his own "broadside" at William Randolph Hearst can be verified as an objective fact. However, the use of the term "broadside" implies a subjective judgment about the nature of Bogdanovich\'s work. Since the sentence cannot be entirely categorized as objective due to the inclusion of this subjective term, it should be classified as subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of cho \'s fans .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence: "a movie that will surely be profane, politically charged music to the ears of cho\'s fans."\n\n1. "a movie that will surely be profane" - This part of the sentence suggests a prediction about the content of the movie, which could be verified as true or false. However, the use of "surely" introduces a level of certainty that might not be based on factual evidence but rather on the speaker\'s belief or expectation.\n\n2. "politically charged" - This phrase describes the movie\'s content as having political themes or implications, which can be a factual description if the movie indeed contains such elements.\n\n3. "music to the ears of cho\'s fans" - This is a metaphorical expression indicating that the movie will be enjoyable or pleasing to the fans of someone named Cho. This part is subjective because it involves a judgment about how the fans will feel about the movie, which can vary from person to person.\n\nGiven the presence of subjective language and the prediction without factual evidence, the overall sentence leans more towards being subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: but cousin roberto is n\'t the tough guy they \'d expected .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after chance brings them together they create , \'searching for mr right . com , `` a web site to locate husbands for marie and liz .\nOutput: user\nThis sentence describes a scenario where two individuals create a website to find husbands, which is a factual statement about an action taken by the subjects. However, the context and the purpose of the action ("to locate husbands for Marie and Liz") might be seen as subjective because it involves personal desires and intentions. Yet, the core of the sentence is describing an action that can be verified, making it more aligned with an objective statement.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: his father , aglanar , was happy at his birth that he would have a strong and honorable son to carry on the traditions of the valley .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull."

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement ("it isn't a bad film"), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as "incredibly dull," which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

These terms express personal feelings and judgments about Barney\'s creation, and they can vary from person to person. Therefore, this sentence is not presenting an objective fact but rather a subjective opinion.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a player in a famous orchestra finds sexual experiences with a russian opera singer , which he enjoys much because his wife has just left due to the fact that he has purchased a porno movie .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters \' striving solipsism .\nOutput: user\nThis sentence is expressing a personal viewpoint regarding the portrayal of characters and themes in a work, likely a film or book. It includes evaluations and critiques that are based on personal feelings and interpretations, which can vary among individuals.

While the terms "peculiar" and "bizarre" are subjective, the sentence itself is describing a sequence of events and changes in circumstances rather than expressing a personal opinion or evaluation. It is presenting a narrative that could be verified through observation or evidence, making it an objective statement.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence: "Land, people, and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored."\n\nThis sentence contains elements that are open to interpretation and personal evaluation. The terms "stark portrait," "motherhood deferred," and "desire explored" are subjective, as they involve personal feelings, evaluations, or critiques. The sentence is describing a narrative or a piece of art in a way that reflects the writer\'s personal interpretation and emotional response.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s exactly the kind of movie toback \'s detractors always accuse him of making .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence: "It\'s exactly the kind of movie Toback\'s detractors always accuse him of making."\n\nThis sentence is expressing a viewpoint that is based on the opinions of Toback\'s detractors. It is not presenting a verifiable fact but rather a perception or critique of Toback\'s work. The use of the term "detractors" implies a subjective judgment about Toback\'s work, and the phrase "always accuse him of making" suggests a recurring opinion or criticism, which is inherently subjective.\n\nTherefore, the classification for this sentence is \'subjective\'.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Thoroughly analyze each sentence to ascertain whether it presents an objective fact, which is a statement that can be proven true or false without regard to personal opinions, or a subjective opinion, which is a personal viewpoint that may vary from person to person.

It expresses a personal evaluation or opinion about the difficulty or quality of life on a reservation ("rez" is a colloquial term for a reservation). The phrase "no picnic" is an idiomatic expression indicating that something is challenging or unpleasant, which is a subjective assessment.\n\nThe second part, "this picture shows you why," suggests that there is a visual representation that explains the reasons for the opinion expressed in the first part. However, without seeing the picture, we can\'t determine if the explanation provided by the image is factual or subjective. The statement itself is subjective because it implies that the picture will confirm a personal viewpoint.\n\nTherefore, the entire sentence is subjective as it conveys a personal perspective and relies on a visual aid to support that perspective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

You need to decide if the sentence conveys an objective fact, which is a statement that can be proven true or false without personal bias, or a subjective opinion, which is a reflection of personal feelings, judgments, or perspectives. Carefully examine each sentence to determine if it presents an objective fact, which can be verified independently of personal opinions, or a subjective opinion, which conveys personal feelings or judgments. Use your understanding of subjective and objective language to label each sentence as 'objective' for statements that are neutral and unbiased, or 'subjective' for those that express personal sentiments or evaluations. Your classification should reveal whether the sentence is 'subjective', indicating it expresses personal views or emotions, or 'objective', indicating it is based on facts and free from bias.

Your task is to categorize each sentence as either 'objective' or 'subjective', indicating whether it consists of unbiased, verifiable information or incorporates personal opinions, emotions, or assessments.

"this film is difficult to watch for the inhumanity it depicts" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it conveys a personal feeling or judgment about the film\'s content and its effect on the viewer.\n\n2. "important to see for its factual elements" - This part is more objective as it refers to the factual content of the film, which can be verified.\n\n3. "the reminder of both the difficulty and importance of maintaining one\'s humanity" - This part is subjective as it involves a personal interpretation and judgment about the film\'s message and its impact on the viewer.\n\nGiven that the sentence contains a mix of subjective and objective elements, but the overall tone leans more towards a personal viewpoint and judgment, the classification would be subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: imamura \'s delight in the infinite oddity of men and women is goofy ; it \'s also , at heart , reverent .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence: "Imamura\'s delight in the infinite oddity of men and women is goofy; it\'s also, at heart, reverent."\n\n1. "Imamura\'s delight in the infinite oddity of men and women is goofy" - This part of the sentence is subjective. The term "goofy" is a personal judgment and conveys a subjective opinion about Imamura\'s delight.\n\n2. "it\'s also, at heart, reverent" - This part is also subjective. The term "reverent" is a personal assessment of the nature of Imamura\'s delight and reflects a subjective opinion.\n\nSince both parts of the sentence contain subjective language, the entire sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Analyze each sentence to determine whether it expresses an objective fact, which is a statement that can be confirmed as true or false without any bias, or a subjective viewpoint, which conveys a personal opinion, feeling, or assessment that can vary among individuals.

However, the use of the word "impressively" introduces a subjective judgment about the quality of the coordination.

The term "stationed" suggests a formal assignment or placement, which can be verified.\n3. The description of the town as "little" is subjective, as it is a relative term and can vary based on personal perception.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence contains both objective and subjective elements.

While the sentence uses the term "grand battle," which could be seen as subjective, the primary action and event described (the march to meet for a battle) are presented as factual occurrences. The term "grand" does introduce a slight subjective element, but the core of the sentence is an objective description of events.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'The dataset comprises sentences that are marked as either subjective or objective. Your assignment is to evaluate each sentence and decide whether it is subjective or objective. Determine if the sentence is conveying objective facts that can be verified or subjective opinions, emotions, and judgments. Your goal is to discern if the sentence is presenting an objective fact, which is a statement that can be proven true or false without personal bias, or a subjective opinion, which reflects personal feelings, judgments, or perspectives. Examine each sentence to determine if it is neutral and unbiased, or if it conveys personal sentiments or evaluations. Use your understanding of subjective and objective language to label each sentence as \'objective\' for statements that are based on facts and free from bias, or \'subjective\' for those that express personal views or emotions. Your classification should indicate whether the sentence is \'subjective\', meaning it expresses personal views or emotions, or \'objective\', meaning it is based on facts and free from bias. Please format your response as follows: <final_answer>your_classification</final_answer>.\n\nInput: ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino \'s climactic shootout M-^W and meat loaf explodes .\nOutput: user\n \n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: but sometimes what we teach our children can be as deadly as not teaching them .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: sure , there are flaws , but the moments that do things properly see the screen burst with confidence , rhythm , heat and pizzazz .\nOutput: user\nThe sentence provided is an expression of personal views and emotions regarding a film or performance. Words like "flaws," "confidence," "rhythm," "heat," and "pizzazz" are subjective terms that convey the writer\'s feelings and judgments rather than stating verifiable facts. Therefore, the sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: herzog , a man of detail became enraptured with his subject and was unable to use his editing shears .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Take a close look at each sentence to decide if it conveys an objective fact, which is a statement that can be proven true or false without any bias, or a subjective opinion, which is based on personal feelings, judgments, or assessments that can differ among individuals.

Please wrap your classification in this format: <final_answer>your_classification</final_answer>.\n\nInput: ken russell would love this . in one scene , we get a stab at soccer hooliganism , a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino \'s climactic shootout M-^W and meat loaf explodes .\nOutput: user\nThe given text is a mix of subjective opinions and references to specific scenes in a film. The statement "ken russell would love this" is a subjective opinion as it expresses a personal judgment about Ken Russell\'s taste. The rest of the sentence describes scenes from a film, which could be considered objective if they accurately represent the film\'s content. However, the use of phrases like "stab at soccer hooliganism" and "rip-off of quentin tarantino\'s climactic shootout" introduce subjective judgments about the quality or nature of these scenes. Therefore, the overall sentiment of the sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the tuxedo was n\'t just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , \'hungry-man portions of bad \' .\nOutput: user\nThis sentence is clearly subjective as it includes a personal judgment and uses a metaphorical expression ("hungry-man portions of bad") to describe the quality of the tuxedo. It reflects the speaker\'s personal feelings and is not a neutral, unbiased statement.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: matches neorealism \'s impact by showing the humanity of a war-torn land filled with people who just want to live their lives .\nOutput: user\nThe given sentence is expressing an interpretation or an evaluation of the impact of neorealism, which involves personal judgment and feelings.

You need to decide if the sentence conveys an objective fact, which is a statement that can be proven true or false without personal bias, or a subjective opinion, which is a reflection of personal feelings, judgments, or perspectives. Carefully examine each sentence to determine if it presents an objective fact, which can be verified independently of personal opinions, or a subjective opinion, which conveys personal feelings or judgments. Use your understanding of subjective and objective language to label each sentence as 'objective' for statements that are neutral and unbiased, or 'subjective' for those that express personal sentiments or evaluations. Your classification should reveal whether the sentence is 'subjective', indicating it expresses personal views or emotions, or 'objective', indicating it is based on facts and free from bias.

The dataset comprises sentences marked as either subjective or objective. Your assignment is to classify each sentence as either subjective or objective based on its content. You need to decide if the sentence conveys an objective fact, which is a statement that can be proven true or false without personal bias, or a subjective opinion, which is a reflection of personal feelings, judgments, or perspectives. Carefully examine each sentence to determine if it presents an objective fact, which can be verified independently of personal opinions, or a subjective opinion, which conveys personal feelings or judgments. Use your understanding of subjective and objective language to label each sentence as 'objective' for statements that are neutral and unbiased, or 'subjective' for those that express personal sentiments or evaluations. Your classification should reveal whether the sentence is 'subjective', indicating it expresses personal views or emotions, or 'objective', indicating it is based on facts and free from bias.
