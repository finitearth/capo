The review mentions that the version is "raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum," which suggests an improvement or an elevation from a lower quality or more childish content. The term "astringent wit" used to describe Allen\'s contribution implies a sharp, clever, and possibly sarcastic humor, which is often valued in creative works for adding depth and complexity.\n\nGiven this analysis, the tone of the review is generally appreciative of the film\'s quality, acknowledging its elevation above more simplistic or childish fare due to the inclusion of clever humor. This indicates a favorable sentiment towards the film.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today \'s hollywood .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: as a girl-meets-girl romantic comedy , kissing jessica steinis quirky , charming and often hilarious .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the emotional content of the given film review, we look at the adjectives used to describe the movie "Kissing Jessica Stein". The words "quirky", "charming", and "hilarious" all have positive connotations, indicating that the reviewer enjoyed the film and found it entertaining. There is no criticism or negative commentary in the review, which suggests a strong positive sentiment. Given the use of multiple positive adjectives without any negative comments, the review can be classified as very positive.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the emotional content of the given film review, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. The comparison to "an afterschool special" typically implies a simplistic or overly moralistic approach, which is often not meant as a compliment in the context of film criticism.\n2. The mention of "costumes by Gianni Versace" adds a note of high fashion, which could be seen as a positive aspect, but in this context, it seems to highlight a disconnect between the film\'s aesthetic and its deeper qualities.\n3. The phrase "looks better than it feels" directly indicates that while the film may have a pleasing appearance, its overall impact or substance is lacking.\n\nGiven these points, the review is not entirely negative, as it acknowledges a positive aspect (the costumes), but it leans towards a negative sentiment because the reviewer seems to be disappointed by the film\'s inability to live up to its visual promise.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Based on careful reading of this movie review, assign it to one of these sentiment categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

Your final classification should be presented as <final_answer> classification </final_answer>.\n\nInput: abysmally pathetic\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze the language used:\n\n1. **"abysmally"** - This adverb means extremely or very badly. It intensifies the adjective that follows, indicating a strong negative sentiment.\n2. **"pathetic"** - This adjective describes something or someone as arousing pity, especially through weakness or inadequacy. It carries a strongly negative connotation.\n\nGiven the use of "abysmally" to intensify "pathetic," the overall sentiment expressed is not just negative but extremely negative. Therefore, the classification of the sentiment in the review is:\n\n<final_answer> very negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: despite an overwrought ending , the film works as well as it does because of the performances .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review mentions a negative aspect ("overwrought ending") but also a positive aspect ("the film works as well as it does because of the performances"). The positive comment seems to outweigh the negative one, as it explains why the film is successful despite its flaws. Therefore, the sentiment is positive, but not extremely enthusiastic, as the reviewer acknowledges a significant drawback.\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the given text, it appears to be describing a scene from a movie, likely an intense or dramatic moment. The actions described, such as "winces", "clutches his chest", and "gasps for breath", suggest a serious or potentially negative situation, but without more context, it\'s difficult to determine the reviewer\'s sentiment towards the movie as a whole. However, given the focus on a dramatic moment without any explicit praise or criticism, the sentiment could be interpreted as neutral, as it describes an action without evaluating it as good or bad.\n\n<final_answer> neutral </final_answer>\n\nInput: this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers \' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: if i want music , i \'ll buy the soundtrack .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

The use of "very amusing" and the acknowledgment of the film taking "not the usual route in a thriller" suggests an appreciation for its uniqueness and entertainment value. The term "pixilated" can imply a quirky or enchanting quality, which, in this context, seems to lean towards a positive interpretation.

The reviewer praises the movie as "smarter and subtler" than other comparable films, which indicates a level of admiration for its intellectual depth and nuanced approach. However, the mention that its plot "may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences" introduces a note of concern about how it might be received by viewers looking for lighter entertainment. This does not seem to detract from the reviewer\'s overall positive opinion of the film\'s quality but suggests an awareness of its limited appeal.

Given the description, the prevailing emotional tone seems to be generally favorable, despite mentioning that the performances are "odd." The use of "very amusing" and the acknowledgment of the film taking "not the usual route in a thriller" suggests an appreciation for its uniqueness and entertainment value.

The reviewer describes the movie as "slow-moving", which implies that the pacing is dull and unengaging.

The use of "very amusing" and the acknowledgment of the film taking "not the usual route in a thriller" suggests an appreciation for its uniqueness and entertainment value. The term "pixilated" can imply a quirky or enchanting quality, which, in this context, seems to lean towards a positive interpretation. Therefore, the sentiment is positive, as it highlights more enjoyable and unique aspects of the film than negative ones.

The use of "sloppy" and "stunningly unoriginal" suggests significant criticisms, but the presence of "amusing" indicates some redeeming quality. However, the negative comments seem to outweigh the positive, as "amusing" is a relatively mild praise compared to the stronger negative language used.\n\nTherefore, the overall sentiment of this critique would be categorized as **negative**,\n\nInput: the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given film critique expresses a highly favorable opinion of the movie, highlighting its ability to evoke strong emotions in the audience, from laughter to a deeper emotional connection with the story. The use of phrases such as "constant fits of laughter," "surprised at how much we care about the story," and "walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched" indicate a strong positive sentiment. The reviewer\'s tone suggests that the film exceeds expectations by not only entertaining but also emotionally resonating with the viewers.

The tone is critical, indicating dissatisfaction with key aspects of the film.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: two-bit potboiler .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the movie review is negative, as it uses words like "misdemeanor", "flat", and "unconvincing" to describe the movie, indicating a lack of enthusiasm or praise.

The review describes the movie as a "slow-moving police-procedural thriller," which suggests that the pace of the movie might be a point of criticism, as "slow-moving" can imply boredom or lack of engagement. Additionally, the phrase "takes its title all too literally" could imply that the reviewer found the movie\'s adherence to its title to be overly simplistic or unimaginative, which further suggests a negative tone.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiment of the review would be classified as negative because it highlights what appears to be a significant drawback (the slow pace) and implies a lack of creativity in how the title\'s theme is explored.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: fun and nimble .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Evaluate the sentiment of a movie review and assign it to one of five emotional categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, by determining the overall tone conveyed in the critique, and provide your classification, framed as <final_answer>your chosen sentiment</final_answer>, to indicate the sentiment that best represents the review's emotional leaning.\n\nInput: the story passes time until it 's time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that 's what makes it worth a recommendation .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the script is smart , not cloying .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Assign a sentiment label to the provided movie review, selecting from a range of five emotional responses: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and encapsulate your selected sentiment category within <final_answer> and </final_answer> markers to clearly indicate the review\'s emotional leaning.\n\nInput: his best film remains his shortest , the hole , which makes many of the points that this film does but feels less repetitive .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review provided seems to offer a mixed assessment but leans towards a somewhat critical stance. It starts with a "good natured warning," which suggests that the reviewer did not entirely dislike the movie but felt it necessary to caution against certain aspects, likely related to its comedic elements or adherence to comedic principles ("laws of laughter"). The tone is not overly harsh but does imply that the movie could improve, especially in future endeavors. Given this, the sentiment is not very negative, as it includes a positive initial reaction, but it\'s also not positive or very positive due to the criticism. Therefore, the sentiment is best described as negative, as it highlights a need for improvement rather than praising the movie outright.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: an impeccable study in perversity .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGiven the context of the phrase "an impeccable study in perversity," it suggests a fascination or admiration for the way something, presumably a movie, explores or portrays perversity in a masterful or flawless manner. The word "impeccable" carries a strongly positive connotation, indicating something done to perfection. Therefore, despite the subject matter being "perversity," which might have negative connotations in other contexts, the overall sentiment here leans towards admiration or approval of how the subject is handled.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review provided expresses dissatisfaction with the progression of the movie, indicating that it starts off well but becomes implausible and contrived as it goes on. This suggests a negative opinion of the movie\'s overall quality and plot development. Therefore, the sentiment label for this review is negative.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: an animation landmark as monumental as disney \'s 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGiven the context of the statement, it appears to be praising the animation by comparing it to a landmark work like Disney\'s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs, which is a highly regarded and influential film. This comparison suggests a high level of admiration and respect for the animation in question. Therefore, the sentiment expressed is very positive due to the significant and positive reference point used for the comparison.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: this quiet , introspective and entertaining independent is worth seeking .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: ... while each moment of this broken character study is rich in emotional texture , the journey does n\'t really go anywhere .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review describes the movie as having "rich in emotional texture," which suggests a positive aspect. However, it also states that "the journey doesn\'t really go anywhere," which indicates a negative aspect.

Given the description, the prevailing emotional tone seems to be generally favorable, despite mentioning that the performances are "odd." The use of "very amusing" and the acknowledgment of the film taking "not the usual route in a thriller" suggests an appreciation for its uniqueness and entertainment value.

Input: a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the emotional undertone of the given movie review, let's analyze the language and tone used. The review describes the movie as a "slow-moving police-procedural thriller," which suggests that the pace of the movie might be a point of criticism, as "slow-moving" can imply boredom or lack of engagement. Additionally, the phrase "takes its title all too literally" could imply that the reviewer found the movie's adherence to its title to be overly simplistic or unimaginative, which further suggests a negative tone.

Given this analysis, the sentiment of the review would be classified as negative because it highlights what appears to be a significant drawback (the slow pace) and implies a lack of creativity in how the title's theme is explored.

Input: a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the emotional undertone of the given movie review, let's analyze the language and tone used. The review describes the movie as a "slow-moving police-procedural thriller," which suggests that the pace of the movie might be a point of criticism, as "slow-moving" can imply boredom or lack of engagement. Additionally, the phrase "takes its title all too literally" could imply that the reviewer found the movie's adherence to its title to be overly simplistic or unimaginative, which further suggests a negative tone.

Given this analysis, the sentiment of the review would be classified as negative because it highlights what appears to be a significant drawback (the slow pace) and implies a lack of creativity in how the title's theme is explored.

This suggests a negative sentiment, but the word "slightly" softens the tone, implying that the disappointment is not extreme. Therefore, the review does not fit into the "very negative" category. \n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: may seriously impair your ability to ever again maintain a straight face while speaking to a highway patrolman .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: plods along , minus the twisted humor and eye-popping visuals that have made miike ... a cult hero .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the emotional tone of the given movie review and categorize it into one of five sentiment categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and insert your selected category between the markers <final_answer> and </final_answer> for a sentiment classification.\n\nInput: intelligent and moving .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe emotional tone of the given movie review is somewhat disappointing, as it mentions that the movie\'s "total promise is left slightly unfulfilled."

The phrase "subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements" could be seen as either positive or negative depending on the context, but in this case, it seems to be a description of the movie\'s content rather than a criticism. Overall, the tone is more positive than negative, but the reviewer\'s criticism of the melodrama prevents it from being very positive.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: this bracingly truthful antidote to hollywood teenage movies that slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it \'s a taunt - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: dreary tale of middle-class angst\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: fun and nimble .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: what starts off as a satisfying kids flck becomes increasingly implausible as it races through contrived plot points .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe emotional tone of the given movie review is negative, as it mentions that the movie becomes "increasingly implausible" and "contrived", indicating a sense of disappointment and criticism. \n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'After thoroughly examining the provided movie review, categorize its sentiment into one of five possible classifications - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - and clearly indicate the assigned category between the markers <final_answer>answer</final_answer>, ensuring an accurate reflection of the review\'s emotional tone.\n\nInput: contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately this is a frustrating patchwork : an uneasy marriage of louis begley \'s source novel -lrb- about schmidt -rrb- and an old payne screenplay .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the provided movie review, "no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild," the sentiment can be categorized as negative due to the use of the word "cliche," which implies a lack of originality, and "perfervid," which means excessively or excessively enthusiastic, possibly in a negative or insincere way.

🧟Generated 4 mutated prompts.
😶Generated Prompts: ['For the task of sentiment analysis, meticulously evaluate the emotional nuances embedded within a movie review and categorize it into one of five distinct sentiment labels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. Upon determining the sentiment, enclose your chosen classification within <final_answer> tags, utilizing the format <final_answer> your_sentiment_classification </final_answer> to clearly convey the emotional undertone of the review, ensuring the selected category accurately represents the sentiment expressed in the movie review.\n\nInput: contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review provided is, "contains all the substance of a twinkie -- easy to swallow , but scarcely nourishing." This statement implies that the movie is lacking in depth or meaningful content, much like a Twinkie, which is known for being easy to consume but not particularly nutritious. The use of "easy to swallow" suggests that the movie might be entertaining or easy to watch, but the phrase "scarcely nourishing" indicates a significant lack of substance or value. This criticism leans towards a negative view of the movie, suggesting it doesn\'t offer much in terms of intellectual stimulation, emotional depth, or lasting impact. However, it doesn\'t seem to express extreme dissatisfaction or anger, which would be characteristic of a "very negative" review. Therefore, the sentiment of this review is best categorized as negative, as it criticizes the movie\'s depth and value without using language that would indicate a stronger negative emotion.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: an animation landmark as monumental as disney \'s 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nGiven the context of the statement, it appears to be praising the significance and impact of an animation, comparing it to a landmark like Disney\'s "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs," which is a highly revered and historically significant film. The use of the word "monumental" suggests a strong positive sentiment, indicating admiration and respect for the animation being discussed. Therefore, the sentiment of this review can be classified as very positive due to the high praise and the comparison to a legendary film.\n\n<final_answer> very positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen \'s astringent wit .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. The review mentions that the version is "raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum," which suggests an improvement or an elevation from a baseline that might be considered childish or simplistic. This implies a somewhat positive view, as it indicates the movie has more depth or quality than something basic or immature.\n\n2. The phrase "by Allen\'s astringent wit" adds that this elevation is due to the writer or director\'s (Allen) sharp, sarcastic, or dry sense of humor. The word "astringent" typically has a positive connotation in literary or cinematic contexts, suggesting a keen, biting wit that can enhance the quality of the work.\n\nGiven these points, the review seems to appreciate the movie for its ability to rise above a common, less sophisticated genre due to its clever writing or direction. There\'s no strong indication of overwhelming praise or enthusiasm that would categorize it as "very positive," nor is there any criticism that would suggest it\'s "negative" or "very negative." The tone is more of a mild approval, acknowledging an improvement or a positive aspect without going into raptures.\n\nHowever, since the review does highlight\n\nInput: control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review "" expresses a strong negative sentiment towards the movie "Simone". The use of the phrase "control-alt-delete", which is a keyboard shortcut to forcibly terminate a program, implies a desire to immediately stop or eliminate the movie, indicating a very negative opinion. \n\n<final_answer> very negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: it works its magic with such exuberance and passion that the film \'s length becomes a part of its fun .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe emotional tone of the given movie review is very positive, as it mentions that the film "works its magic" and that its length is "a part of its fun", indicating a high level of enthusiasm and enjoyment. \n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: this low-rent -- and even lower-wit -- rip-off of the farrelly brothers \' oeuvre gets way too mushy -- and in a relatively short amount of time .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'To determine the sentiment of a movie review, evaluate its content and assign it to one of five emotional tone categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and then identify the category that most accurately reflects the review\'s sentiment, placing your selected category between <final_answer> and </final_answer> for classification purposes.\n\nInput: as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review seems to be focused on Madonna\'s singing abilities rather than her acting skills, despite mentioning her as an actress. The phrase "one helluva singer" is a colloquial expression that means being exceptionally good at something. Given this context, the sentiment of the review is very positive towards Madonna\'s singing talent.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: -lrb- `` safe conduct \'\' -rrb- is a long movie at 163 minutes but it fills the time with drama , romance , tragedy , bravery , political intrigue , partisans and sabotage .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze its content:\n\n1. The review mentions that the movie is "long" but justifies its length by stating it is filled with various engaging elements such as drama, romance, tragedy, bravery, political intrigue, partisans, and sabotage. This suggests that the reviewer finds the content rich and engaging, which is a positive aspect.\n\n2. The inclusion of a wide range of genres and themes (drama, romance, tragedy, bravery, political intrigue, partisans, and sabotage) implies that the movie offers a complex and possibly captivating narrative, which could appeal to a wide audience.\n\n3. There is no negative commentary or criticism in the review regarding the movie\'s quality, acting, direction, or any other aspect. The tone seems to appreciate the variety and depth of the movie\'s content.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentiment of the review is positive because it highlights the movie\'s ability to engage the audience with its diverse and complex content without mentioning any drawbacks. Therefore, the category that most accurately reflects the review\'s sentiment is:\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it \'s a taunt - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: they \'re just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze its content:\n\n1. The review starts with a somewhat dismissive tone by referring to the protagonists as "just a couple of cops in copmovieland," which could initially suggest a negative sentiment. However, the use of "just" might also imply a familiarity or a commonality that isn\'t necessarily negative.\n2. The phrase "but in narc, they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood" introduces a contrast to the initial part of the sentence. The word "but" indicates a turn or an exception, suggesting that despite the familiar setup, the movie offers something new or different.\n3. The phrase "find new routes through a familiar neighborhood" is positive. It implies innovation, creativity, or a fresh perspective within a genre that might otherwise be seen as clichéd or overly familiar. This suggests that the movie brings something unique or interesting to the table.\n\nGiven these observations, the overall sentiment of the review seems to be positive. The reviewer acknowledges the familiar setting but highlights the movie\'s ability to innovate within that setting, which is seen as a strength.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving ...\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the content of the review, which describes the movie as "a captivating and intimate study about dying and loving," the sentiment expressed is overwhelmingly positive, indicating a strong appreciation for the movie\'s themes and portrayal. Therefore, the category that most accurately reflects the review\'s sentiment is: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>.\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the emotional tone of a given movie review and categorize it into one of five sentiment levels - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - which represent the degree of emotional intensity conveyed in the review, and encapsulate your classification within the designated markers as <final_answer> your_sentiment_classification </final_answer> to precisely convey the sentiment and emotional intensity of the review.\n\nInput: there are problems with this film that even 3 oscar winners ca n\'t overcome , but it \'s a nice girl-buddy movie once it gets rock-n-rolling .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: an empty shell of an epic rather than the real deal .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review provided is brief but clearly conveys a sense of disappointment and criticism towards the movie, indicating that it failed to meet the reviewer\'s expectations of being an epic film. The phrase "an empty shell" strongly suggests a lack of substance or fulfillment, which aligns with a negative sentiment. However, the tone does not seem to express extreme anger or hatred, which would be characteristic of a "very negative" review.

The inclusion of both positive themes (romance, bravery) and negative themes (tragedy) indicates a balanced narrative, but the overall listing of these elements in a neutral or matter-of-fact way without explicit criticism suggests a leaning towards a positive sentiment. However, the description does not use superlatives or emphatic language that would indicate a very positive sentiment.

The term "half-hearted" typically carries a negative connotation, suggesting a lack of sincerity or effort, which leans towards a negative sentiment. However, the tone does not seem to be extremely harsh or condemnatory, which might suggest a very negative classification. Therefore, the sentiment of this review can be classified as negative, as it criticizes the perceived lack of genuine change or effort but does not use language that is strongly derogatory or dismissive.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given movie review is: "what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes."\n\nThis review suggests that the movie starts off well but loses its momentum and becomes dull or unengaging as it progresses, particularly due to its lengthy duration. The phrase "gets bogged down" has a negative connotation, indicating a decline in the reviewer\'s interest or enjoyment.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiment of the review can be classified as negative because it expresses disappointment and dissatisfaction with the movie\'s ability to maintain its initial appeal throughout its runtime.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito \'s way .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given movie review is: "looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito\'s way." \n\nThis review implies that the movie lacks originality and is reminiscent of other, potentially better, films. The term "low-budget" often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that the movie\'s production quality may be subpar. However, it does not express extreme dissatisfaction or anger. \n\nGiven these observations, the sentiment of the review can be classified as negative, as it criticizes the movie\'s originality and production quality without using extremely harsh language.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The review uses the phrase "completely spooky piece of business," which indicates a strong emotional impact. The word "spooky" can have a negative connotation, but in the context of a movie, especially one that aims to be spooky or horror-themed, it can be seen as a positive aspect, suggesting the movie is effective in evoking the intended emotional response.\n\n2. **Criticism and Praise**: The review mentions "some plot blips aside," which indicates there are some criticisms or flaws in the movie. However, the phrase "stays there for the duration" suggests that despite these flaws, the movie has a lasting impact or effect on the viewer, which is a positive aspect.\n\n3. **Overall Sentiment**: The review seems to focus more on the positive aspects of the movie, such as its ability to evoke a strong emotional response and its lasting impact, rather than dwelling on the negative aspects like plot flaws. The tone suggests admiration for the movie\'s effectiveness in achieving its intended spooky atmosphere.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentiment of the review is more positive than negative. It acknowledges flaws but emphasizes the movie\'s\n\nInput: the master of disguise is funny -- not `` ha ha \'\' funny , `` dead circus performer \'\' funny .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given movie review is: "you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain."\n\nThis review suggests that the viewer is eagerly waiting for the movie to end, much like the desert longs for rain. The comparison to a desert, which is typically a dry and barren place, implies a sense of desperation and dryness in the viewing experience. The tone is clearly negative, indicating that the movie is dull and unengaging.\n\nConsidering the emotional nuances embedded in the review, I would classify it as <final_answer> very negative </final_answer>.\n\nInput: if ayurveda can help us return to a sane regimen of eating , sleeping and stress-reducing contemplation , it is clearly a good thing .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given review expresses a generally favorable opinion towards Ayurveda, highlighting its potential benefits in promoting a healthy lifestyle. The use of the phrase "it is clearly a good thing" indicates a positive sentiment. However, the tone is cautious and conditional, as the benefits of Ayurveda are dependent on its ability to help people adopt a sane regimen. There is no extremely enthusiastic or effusive language, which suggests that the sentiment is positive but not extremely positive. \n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput:']

The use of positive phrases such as "rises above" and "good old-fashioned escapism" indicates a strong appreciation for the movie. Therefore, the sentiment of this review can be classified as positive.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the film makes strong arguments regarding the social status of america \'s indigenous people , but really only exists to try to eke out an emotional tug of the heart , one which it fails to get .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: the best animated feature to hit theaters since beauty and the beast 11 years ago .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the given movie review, the emotional undertone is extremely favorable, indicating a high level of enthusiasm and praise for the movie. The comparison to a classic like "Beauty and the Beast" further emphasizes the reviewer\'s admiration. Therefore, the sentiment of this review can be classified as very positive.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today \'s hollywood .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the emotional tone of a given movie review and categorize it into one of five sentiment levels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, by carefully considering the language and emotional undertones used in the review. Then, select the most appropriate sentiment category and enclose your classification within the designated markers as <final_answer> your chosen sentiment </final_answer> to effectively capture the essence of the review\'s sentiment.\n\nInput: in death to smoochy , we do n\'t get williams \' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: there \'s something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: taken as a whole , the tuxedo does n\'t add up to a whole lot .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the emotional tone of the given movie review, let\'s analyze the language and emotional undertones used. The review states, "taken as a whole, the tuxedo doesn\'t add up to a whole lot." The phrase "doesn\'t add up to a whole lot" implies a lack of significance or value, which suggests a negative opinion of the movie. However, the tone does not seem to be extremely harsh or angry, which might suggest a "very negative" sentiment. Instead, it appears to be more mildly disappointed or unimpressed.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiment of the review is best categorized as <final_answer> negative </final_answer>.\n\nInput: in the wrong hands , i.e. peploe \'s , it \'s simply unbearable\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the emotional tone of the given movie review, let\'s break down the key elements:\n\n1. **Comparison to an afterschool special**: This comparison typically implies that the content is simplistic, possibly cheesy, or overly moralistic, which is often associated with negative connotations.\n2. **Mention of costumes by Gianni Versace**: This adds a positive note, suggesting that at least the visual or aesthetic aspect of the movie is of high quality.\n3. **"looks better than it feels"**: This phrase indicates a disconnect between the movie\'s appearance (which is positive) and its overall impact or enjoyment (which is negative).\n\nGiven these points, the reviewer seems to appreciate the movie\'s visual appeal but is disappointed with its overall quality or the experience of watching it. This suggests a negative sentiment, as the positive aspect (the costumes) is outweighed by the negative feeling the movie evokes.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the emotional tone conveyed in a given movie review, categorizing it into one of five distinct sentiment groups: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, through a thorough analysis of the review\'s content. Subsequently, encapsulate your determined sentiment classification within <final_answer>answer</final_answer> tags to explicitly denote the review\'s emotional categorization.\n\nInput: for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the emotional tone conveyed in the given movie review, let\'s analyze its content:\n\n1. The review starts with "for those in search of something different," which suggests that the movie offers a unique experience. This phrase is neutral, as it simply indicates the movie\'s uniqueness without expressing a sentiment.\n\n2. The word "wendigo" is mentioned, which is the title of the movie being reviewed. The mention of the title itself does not convey any sentiment.\n\n3. The phrase "is a genuinely bone-chilling tale" expresses a strong positive sentiment. The word "genuinely" emphasizes the authenticity of the sentiment, and "bone-chilling" is a strong adjective that suggests the movie is effectively frightening or intense in a way that resonates with the viewer.\n\nGiven this analysis, the review\'s content suggests that the reviewer holds the movie in high regard, particularly for its ability to evoke a strong, chilling response from the viewer. This indicates a positive sentiment towards the movie.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a slick , engrossing melodrama .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n\'t seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the emotional tone of the given movie review, let\'s break down its key components and analyze the language used:\n\n1. **"this rush to profits"** - The phrase suggests a criticism of the movie\'s production or release strategy, implying that financial gain was prioritized over other aspects, which sets a negative tone.\n2. **"a predictably efficient piece of business"** - This phrase reinforces the idea that the movie is more focused on commercial success than artistic or creative merit, further contributing to a negative sentiment.\n3. **"notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness"** - The use of "overwhelming creepiness" as a notable aspect of the movie introduces a strong negative emotional response.

The use of the word "weak" to describe the detail suggests a negative aspect, but the phrase "strong on personality" indicates a positive aspect.

This implies poor direction or production quality, contributing to a negative view of the movie.\n\n3. **"overshadows everything"** - This phrase indicates that the negative aspects (specifically, the exploitative and clumsily staged violence) dominate the viewer\'s experience, suggesting that other potentially positive elements (like the acting) are eclipsed by these flaws.\n\n4. **"including most of the actors"** - The mention that the poor quality of the violence overshadows "most of the actors" implies that even the performances, which are often a highlight of films, are negatively impacted or not notable due to the movie\'s other significant flaws.\n\nGiven this\n\nInput: a rollicking ride , with jaw-dropping action sequences , striking villains , a gorgeous color palette , astounding technology , stirring music and a boffo last hour that leads up to a strangely sinister happy ending .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the story passes time until it \'s time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: eastwood winces , clutches his chest and gasps for breath .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: this rush to profits has created a predictably efficient piece of business notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness , for an eagerness to create images you wish you had n\'t seen , which , in this day and age , is of course the point .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down its key components and analyze the language used:\n\n1. **"this rush to profits"** - The phrase suggests a criticism of the movie\'s production or release strategy, implying that financial gain was prioritized over other aspects, such as quality or viewer experience.\n2. **"a predictably efficient piece of business"** - This part of the sentence reinforces the idea that the movie was made with profit in mind, using the word "efficient" in a somewhat negative context to imply a lack of originality or genuine effort.\n3. **"notable largely for its overwhelming creepiness"** - The use of "overwhelming creepiness" as a notable aspect of the movie indicates a strong negative reaction to its content. The word "creepiness" has a strongly negative connotation.\n4. **"for an eagerness to create images you wish you hadn\'t seen"** - This further emphasizes the reviewer\'s negative experience, suggesting that the movie includes disturbing or unwanted content.\n5. **"which, in this day and age, is of course the point"** - This final part of the sentence seems to criticize the current state of media or societal trends for priorit\n\nInput: i simply ca n\'t recommend it enough .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the sentiment of a movie review by determining its emotional tone, which can range from very negative to very positive, and categorize it into one of five sentiment levels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, then provide your classification within <final_answer> your_sentiment_classification </final_answer>, making sure it accurately represents the reviewer\'s emotional stance and sentiment intensity expressed in the review.\n\nInput: the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today \'s hollywood .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke \'s portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: while this one gets off with a good natured warning , future lizard endeavors will need to adhere more closely to the laws of laughter\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: ... a fascinating curiosity piece -- fascinating , that is , for about ten minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. The review starts with "a fascinating curiosity piece," which suggests an initial positive interest or intrigue.\n2. However, it immediately qualifies this fascination as being "for about ten minutes." This implies that the reviewer\'s interest was short-lived.\n\nGiven these points, the reviewer seems to express a mixed sentiment but leans more towards a negative view due to the brevity of their engagement and the lack of sustained interest. The use of "fascinating" could suggest a positive initial reaction, but the limitation of this fascination to "about ten minutes" diminishes the overall positive sentiment, preventing it from being classified as positive or very positive. It does not seem to be very negative since the reviewer does acknowledge some level of fascination. Therefore, the sentiment is more aligned with a negative classification because the reviewer\'s positive sentiment is significantly tempered by the short duration of their interest.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: the story passes time until it \'s time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: the way home is an ode to unconditional love and compassion garnered from years of seeing it all , a condition only the old are privy to , and ... often misconstrued as weakness .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"an ode to unconditional love and compassion"** - This phrase suggests a deep appreciation and admiration for the themes of love and compassion presented in the movie. The use of "ode" implies a poetic or lyrical quality, which is typically associated with positive sentiments.\n\n2. **"garnered from years of seeing it all"** - This part of the sentence implies experience and wisdom, which are generally viewed positively, especially in the context of learning or understanding.\n\n3. **"a condition only the old are privy to"** - This could be seen as neutral or slightly positive, as it acknowledges a unique perspective or wisdom that comes with age.\n\n4. **"and ... often misconstrued as weakness"** - This part introduces a contrast, suggesting that what might be perceived as a negative trait by some is actually valued in the context of the movie. This indicates an appreciation for depth and complexity in the film\'s portrayal of characters or themes.\n\nGiven these observations, the overall tone of the review is positive. It highlights themes of love, compassion, and wisdom in a favorable light, suggesting that the reviewer holds the movie in high regard.\n\nInput: in death to smoochy , we do n\'t get williams \' usual tear and a smile , just sneers and bile , and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"in death to smoochy , we do n\'t get williams \' usual tear and a smile"** - This part of the sentence suggests a deviation from the expected, which could initially seem negative. However, it\'s setting up a contrast.\n\n2. **"just sneers and bile"** - At face value, "sneers and bile" have negative connotations, implying something unpleasant or hateful.\n\n3. **"and the spectacle is nothing short of refreshing"** - The word "refreshing" has a strongly positive connotation, implying something is invigorating or pleasantly surprising.\n\nGiven these points, the reviewer seems to appreciate the deviation from the expected, finding the result "refreshing." This indicates that despite the mention of negative terms like "sneers and bile," the overall sentiment is positive because the reviewer finds the change of pace or the unexpected direction of the movie to be a good thing.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment of the review is positive, as it highlights an appreciation for the movie\'s unconventional approach, which the reviewer did not expect but found enjoyable.\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'For the task of sentiment analysis, meticulously examine the emotional nuances embedded within a movie review, and subsequently assign it to one of five distinct sentiment categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - ensuring to encapsulate your classification within the designated markers as <final_answer> your_sentiment_classification </final_answer>, thereby providing an accurate representation of the sentiment conveyed in the film review.\n\nInput: twenty years after its first release , e.t. remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg \'s misunderstood career .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given movie review expresses a highly favorable opinion of the film "E.T.", using words such as "wondrous" and "apex" to describe it. The reviewer also praises the director, Steven Spielberg, by stating that the film is the pinnacle of his career. This suggests a strong admiration for the film and its director.

This suggests an interaction or performance that is noteworthy.\n\n2. **Analyze Emotional Nuances**: The word "treat" has a positive connotation, indicating something enjoyable or pleasing to watch. The phrase "melting under the heat" can imply a strong, possibly overwhelming, reaction, but in this context, it seems to suggest a captivating or endearing performance rather than a negative one.\n\n3. **Consider the Tone**: The tone appears to be one of admiration or appreciation, focusing on the enjoyment of watching Shaw\'s performance under specific circumstances.\n\n4. **Sentiment Classification**: Given the positive language used ("a treat"), the review seems to express a favorable sentiment towards the performance or scene being described.\n\n5. **Final Classification**: Since the review uses positive language to describe the experience of watching the performance, it falls into a positive sentiment category.

This balance doesn\'t lean heavily towards a very negative or very positive sentiment. Instead, it presents a mixed view that is more neutral, acknowledging both negative and positive elements. However, the recognition of something "vital" about the movie slightly tips the balance towards a positive interpretation, as it indicates an appreciation for the movie beyond its flaws.\n\nInput: twenty years after its first release , e.t. remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg \'s misunderstood career .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: seagal , who looks more like danny aiello these days , mumbles his way through the movie .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: an ambitious ` what if ? \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, "," let\'s break down the components and implications of the statement.\n\n1. **Ambitious**: This term generally carries a positive connotation, suggesting that the movie has high goals or aspirations. It implies a level of complexity, depth, or innovation that is commendable.\n\n2. **`what if ?`**: This part of the statement introduces a speculative or questioning element. It suggests that the movie explores interesting, perhaps unconventional ideas or scenarios, which can be intriguing and thought-provoking.\n\nGiven these points, the overall sentiment of the review seems to lean towards the positive. The use of "ambitious" indicates admiration for the movie\'s scope or goals, and the speculative nature of "what if?" suggests engagement and interest. However, the review is brief and does not explicitly state overwhelming praise or criticism, which might suggest a very positive or very negative sentiment, respectively.\n\nTherefore, considering the positive implications of "ambitious" and the engaging nature of "what if?," but also taking into account the brevity and lack of superlatives in the review, the sentiment can be classified as positive, as it indicates a favorable view without reaching the intensity\n\nInput: the obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down its components and analyze the emotional nuances embedded within it.\n\n1. **"the obnoxious title character"**: The use of the word "obnoxious" has a negative connotation, indicating that the reviewer did not have a favorable view of the title character. This suggests a negative sentiment.\n\n2. **"provides the drama"**: The word "drama" can be neutral or positive depending on the context. In the context of a movie review, drama can be seen as a positive aspect, as it often contributes to the engagement and interest of the audience.\n\n3. **"that gives added clout to this doc"**: The phrase "gives added clout" suggests that the drama provided by the title character enhances the documentary ("doc") in some way, making it more impactful or noteworthy. The word "clout" implies influence or prestige, which is a positive attribute.\n\nConsidering these points, the review seems to balance a negative description of the title character with an acknowledgment of how this character positively contributes to the documentary. The reviewer seems to appreciate the value the title character adds to the documentary, despite finding the character "obnoxious." This balance suggests that the overall\n\nInput:']

This mixed assessment doesn\'t lean towards the extremes (very negative or very positive) but rather suggests a middle-ground sentiment that acknowledges both positive and negative aspects.\n\nGiven the language and tone, the sentiment of the review is best described as **negative** because, despite acknowledging a positive aspect (emotional texture), the overarching criticism about the journey not going anywhere dominates the sentiment, indicating a general dissatisfaction with the movie\'s overall impact.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Evaluate the emotional tone of a given movie review and categorize it into one of five distinct sentiment groups: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, by thoughtfully considering the language and emotional undertones used in the review, then clearly indicate your chosen sentiment category within the designated markers as <final_answer> your selected sentiment </final_answer> to effectively capture the essence of the movie review's sentiment.\n\nInput: no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: there 's something to be said for a studio-produced film that never bothers to hand viewers a suitcase full of easy answers .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput:", "Assess the sentiment of the given movie review, categorizing it into one of five emotional tones: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

The reviewer mentions that the movie starts off satisfactorily but becomes implausible and contrived as it progresses. This indicates a negative sentiment, as the reviewer is unhappy with the direction the movie takes. However, the reviewer does mention that it "starts off as a satisfying kids flck," which suggests that the movie is not entirely bad, but rather it has some redeeming qualities that are overshadowed by its flaws. Therefore, the sentiment can be classified as negative, but not very negative.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Once you\'ve made your determination, place your chosen category within the designated markers as <final_answer> your selected sentiment </final_answer> to accurately reflect the review\'s emotional tone and categorize it appropriately.\n\nInput: for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down its components:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The review uses the phrase "genuinely bone-chilling tale," which has a strong positive connotation. The word "genuinely" emphasizes the authenticity of the experience, suggesting that the reviewer was deeply impressed. "Bone-chilling" is a powerful adjective that indicates the movie had a significant emotional impact, evoking fear or intense suspense in a way that the reviewer found compelling.\n\n2. **Emotions and Opinions Expressed**: The review expresses a clear recommendation ("for those in search of something different") followed by a positive description of the movie ("a genuinely bone-chilling tale"). This indicates that the reviewer holds the movie in high regard, particularly for its ability to deliver a unique and impactful viewing experience.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentiment of the review is clearly on the positive side, as it highlights the movie\'s ability to evoke strong emotions in a way that the reviewer found commendable. The use of "genuinely bone-chilling" suggests a level of enthusiasm and admiration that goes beyond a merely positive assessment, indicating that the reviewer\'s experience was not just good but exceptionally good.\n\nTherefore, the review\'s sentiment\n\nInput: this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today \'s hollywood .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe language and tone used in the review suggest a strong criticism towards the movie. The reviewer describes the movie as "disposable" and a "kitchen-sink homage," which implies that the movie lacks originality and substance. The phrase "the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts" further emphasizes the reviewer\'s disappointment and frustration with the movie. The tone is also somewhat sarcastic, with the reviewer stating that the result is "ironically" what they criticize about Hollywood. Overall, the review expresses a strong negative opinion towards the movie.\n\n<final_answer> very negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe language used in the review is somewhat critical, indicating that the movie did not quite live up to its potential. The phrase "left slightly unfulfilled" suggests a sense of disappointment, but the tone is not overly harsh or condemnatory. The word "slightly" also implies that the disappointment is not extreme. Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the review can be categorized as negative, but not very negative, as it acknowledges some level of promise in the movie.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of this movie review, let\'s break down its key components:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The review mentions that the movie shows "its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places," which suggests some level of criticism or acknowledgment of the movie\'s flaws, particularly in relation to its independent production background. However, it also describes the movie as having "some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety," which indicates appreciation for certain aspects of the film.\n\n2. **Emotions and Opinions Expressed**: The use of the phrase "quietly moving moments" indicates a positive emotional response to parts of the movie. The acknowledgment of "intelligent subtlety" further suggests that the reviewer found some depth or thoughtful elements in the film. The criticism is more about the production quality or the noticeable "indie" aspects rather than the content or message of the movie itself.\n\n3. **Balance of Criticism and Praise**: The review balances criticism (mention of flaws) with praise (acknowledgment of moving moments and intelligent subtlety). This balance suggests that the reviewer\'s overall sentiment is not extremely negative or extremely positive but rather somewhere in between.\n\nGiven these observations, the review does not lean towards being very negative\n\nInput:', "Evaluate the emotional undertone of a movie review and assign it to one of five distinct sentiment categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - based on a meticulous analysis of its content, and then identify the sentiment label that best captures the reviewer's sentiment, enclosing your selected category within <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags to effectively categorize the review.\n\nInput: ... a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> very positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke 's portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:"]

😶Generated Prompts: ['Assess the sentiment of a movie review by meticulously analyzing its content and then categorize it into one of five emotional tone categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, clearly indicating the classification within <final_answer>answer</final_answer> tags to represent the review\'s sentiment.\n\nInput: indeed , the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down its content:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The review mentions that "the more outrageous bits achieve a shock-you-into-laughter intensity of almost dadaist proportions." The use of "outrageous" and "shock-you-into-laughter" suggests a strong, intense reaction, but one that is framed positively as it leads to laughter. The reference to "dadaist proportions" implies a level of absurdity or surrealism that is notable.\n\n2. **Emotional Indicators**: The key emotional indicator here is "laughter," which is a positive emotional response. The review suggests that the movie\'s outrageous bits are successful in eliciting this response, indicating an effective comedic strategy.\n\n3. **Overall Sentiment**: Given that the review highlights a positive aspect of the movie (its ability to induce laughter through outrageous and absurd content), it leans towards a positive sentiment. The intensity of the language ("shock-you-into-laughter," "dadaist proportions") suggests a strong appreciation for the movie\'s comedic elements.\n\n4. **Classification**: Considering the review\'s focus on the positive aspect of the movie\'s ability to induce laughter and the strong language used to\n\nInput: while the importance of being earnest offers opportunities for occasional smiles and chuckles , it does n\'t give us a reason to be in the theater beyond wilde \'s wit and the actors \' performances .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down its key components:\n\n1. **"fast paced"** - This term suggests that the movie maintains a quick and engaging rhythm, which is generally a positive attribute in film.\n2. **"suspenseful"** - Suspense is a key element in thrillers, indicating that the movie successfully incorporates tension and anticipation, keeping viewers engaged.\n3. **"argentinian thriller"** - The specification of the movie\'s origin and genre provides context but does not inherently carry a positive or negative connotation.\n4. **"about the shadow side of play"** - This phrase implies the movie explores deeper, possibly darker themes related to "play," which could be intriguing and thought-provoking.\n\nGiven these points, the review highlights positive aspects of the movie, such as its pacing and suspense, without mentioning any criticisms. The description focuses on engaging elements that would attract viewers interested in thrillers.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a different movie -- sometimes tedious -- by a director many viewers would like to skip but film buffs should get to know .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down its components:\n\n1. **"a different movie"**: This phrase is neutral. It simply states that the movie is distinct without implying whether this difference is good or bad.\n\n2. **"sometimes tedious"**: This part of the review introduces a negative sentiment. The word "tedious" means boring or dull, indicating that the reviewer found parts of the movie unengaging.\n\n3. **"by a director many viewers would like to skip"**: This statement further emphasizes a negative sentiment. It suggests that the director\'s work is not well-regarded by many, to the point where viewers might intentionally avoid their films.\n\n4. **"but film buffs should get to know"**: Despite the negative sentiments expressed, this part of the review introduces a positive note. It implies that, despite potential drawbacks, the movie (or the director\'s work) has value, particularly for those who are enthusiastic about film.\n\nConsidering these points, the review contains both negative and positive sentiments. The negative aspects ("sometimes tedious," "many viewers would like to skip") are balanced by a positive recommendation for a specific audience ("film buffs should get to know"). The overall tone is not overwhelmingly negative or\n\nInput: the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down its content:\n\n1. **"no cliche escapes"** - This phrase suggests that the movie does not avoid or challenge common tropes, which could imply a lack of originality or depth.\n2. **"the perfervid treatment"** - The word "perfervid" means excessively enthusiastic or passionate. In this context, it could indicate an over-the-top or melodramatic portrayal.\n3. **"of gang warfare"** - This subject matter is often associated with violence, crime, and social issues, which can be intense and serious.\n4. **"called ces wild"** - The mention of a specific title ("ces wild") suggests the reviewer is discussing a particular film, but without more context, it\'s hard to discern the tone from this alone.\n\nGiven the language used, the reviewer seems to criticize the movie for possibly being overly dramatic or unoriginal in its portrayal of gang warfare. The tone appears to be critical rather than praising.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: a mean-spirited film made by someone who surely read the catcher in the rye but clearly suffers from dyslexia\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: ... a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'For the task of sentiment analysis, meticulously assess the emotional nuances embedded within a movie review and categorize it into one of five distinct sentiment labels - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - that best captures the reviewer\'s sentiment, then encapsulate your classification within the designated markers as <final_answer> your_sentiment_classification </final_answer> to provide an accurate representation of the review\'s emotional tone.\n\nInput: observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze it step by step:\n\n1. **Observant Intelligence**: The use of the word "observant" suggests a level of appreciation for the movie\'s intelligence, indicating a positive aspect.\n2. **Vies with Pretension**: The term "pretension" has a negative connotation, implying that the movie sometimes comes across as overly ambitious or trying too hard, which is a criticism.\n3. **Plain Wacky Implausibility**: The phrase "plain wacky implausibility" further emphasizes the negative aspects, suggesting that the movie has parts that are not only unbelievable but also absurdly so.\n\nGiven these points, the review highlights both positive and negative aspects of the movie. The reviewer seems to appreciate the movie\'s intelligence but criticizes its pretentiousness and implausibility. This balance does not lean heavily towards extreme positivity or negativity but rather suggests a mixed opinion.\n\nTherefore, considering the reviewer\'s acknowledgment of both positive and negative elements without a clear dominance of either, the sentiment can be classified as **neutral**. This classification reflects the reviewer\'s balanced view, which neither overwhelmingly praises nor condemns the movie.\n\n<final_answer> neutral </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Assess the emotional undertone of the provided movie review and assign it to one of five distinct sentiment categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - that accurately captures the reviewer's sentiment, and then enclose your assessment within the specified markers as <final_answer> your selected sentiment </final_answer> to clearly indicate the review's overall emotional tone.\n\nInput: this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: the idea is more interesting than the screenplay , which lags badly in the middle and lurches between not-very-funny comedy , unconvincing dramatics and some last-minute action strongly reminiscent of run lola run .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: and there 's an element of heartbreak to watching it now , with older and wiser eyes , because we know what will happen after greene 's story ends .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the master of disguise is funny -- not `` ha ha '' funny , `` dead circus performer '' funny .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> very negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it 's looking for .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the given movie review, the emotional tone can be classified as neutral, since it neither fully praises nor criticizes the movie, but rather mentions that it finds its footing only towards the end. \n\n<final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: ` in this poor remake of such a well loved classic , parker exposes the limitations of his skill and the basic flaws in his vision . '\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> very negative </final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Evaluate the sentiment of a movie review by determining its emotional tone, which can range from very negative to very positive, and assign it to one of five categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, based on the language and feelings expressed in the review, and then provide your classification within <final_answer> the chosen sentiment category </final_answer>, ensuring that your assessment accurately reflects the reviewer\'s sentiment.\n\nInput: ... a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> very positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze the language and feelings expressed. The review states that "the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women." The key phrase here is "very good," which indicates a strong positive sentiment. The review does not contain any negative language or criticisms, suggesting that the reviewer holds the film in high regard, at least for its target audience.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiment of the review is positive, but since it uses the phrase "very good," it leans towards a stronger positive sentiment without being overly enthusiastic or using superlatives that would categorize it as "very positive." However, considering the context and the positive adjective used, it\'s reasonable to classify the sentiment as positive, given the absence of any negative commentary and the specific endorsement for a particular demographic.\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput:']

😶Generated Prompts: ['Evaluate the sentiment of a movie review, determining whether it falls into one of five emotional categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and then encapsulate your evaluation between <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags, accurately reflecting the reviewer\'s sentiment.\n\nInput: taken as a whole , the tuxedo does n\'t add up to a whole lot .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the review, "taken as a whole, the tuxedo doesn\'t add up to a whole lot," the sentiment can be evaluated as negative. The phrase "doesn\'t add up to a whole lot" implies a lack of satisfaction or a significant disappointment with the movie, indicating that it failed to meet the reviewer\'s expectations in a substantial way.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: the isolated moments of creative insanity finally are lost in the thin soup of canned humor .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, we first note that the statement seems to be more about Madonna\'s abilities as a singer rather than a direct review of a movie. However, considering the context that might imply her acting career, the sentiment can still be inferred. The phrase "one helluva singer" is a colloquial expression meaning exceptionally good or talented. Given this, the sentiment of the statement is very positive towards Madonna\'s singing abilities, which can be extended to imply a positive view of her talents in general, including potentially her acting.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, "this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done," let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **"Seductive tease"** - The word "seductive" has a positive connotation, implying something attractive or alluring. "Tease" can imply something that is intriguing or enticing, which is also positive in this context.\n2. **"Thriller"** - This is a neutral term, simply stating the genre of the movie.\n3. **"Gets the job done"** - This phrase is generally positive, indicating that the movie is effective in its purpose, which in this case is to thrill or entertain.\n\nGiven these points, the overall sentiment of the review is positive. It does not contain extremely positive language that would categorize it as "very positive," nor does it express any negative sentiments.

The use of the word "charming" implies a sense of delight and affection, while "hilarious" indicates that the reviewer found the movie to be comedic and entertaining. Overall, the language used is upbeat and enthusiastic, indicating a very positive sentiment.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: brash , intelligent and erotically perplexing , haneke \'s portrait of an upper class austrian society and the suppression of its tucked away demons is uniquely felt with a sardonic jolt .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review uses words like "brash" and "erotically perplexing" to describe the movie, which suggests a sense of intrigue and fascination. The phrase "sardonic jolt" also implies a sense of surprise and engagement. Additionally, the reviewer describes the director\'s portrait of Austrian society as "uniquely felt", which indicates a high level of appreciation for the film\'s originality and emotional resonance. Overall, the tone of the review is one of admiration and enthusiasm. \n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: control-alt-delete simone as quickly as possible\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review "" is brief but expresses a strong sentiment. The use of "control-alt-delete," a keyboard shortcut for terminating a program, metaphorically suggests a desire to eliminate or get rid of something, in this case, "Simone." The urgency implied by "as quickly as possible" further emphasizes the negative sentiment. Given the direct and forceful language, this review falls into the category of being very negative, as it clearly expresses a strong dislike or frustration towards the subject, Simone.\n\n<final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: davis the performer is plenty fetching enough , but she needs to shake up the mix , and work in something that does n\'t feel like a half-baked stand-up routine .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the sentiment of a movie review by discerning its emotional nuances and assigning it to one of five categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - based on the language and tone used, and then encapsulate your classification within the <final_answer>answer</final_answer> markers to convey the review\'s emotional tone with precision.\n\nInput: the obnoxious title character provides the drama that gives added clout to this doc .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down its components:\n\n1. **"obnoxious title character"**: The use of "obnoxious" has a negative connotation, indicating that the reviewer did not have a favorable view of the character. However, it\'s essential to consider the context in which "obnoxious" is used. In this case, it seems to contribute to the drama, which is seen as a positive aspect.\n\n2. **"provides the drama"**: This phrase suggests that the character\'s obnoxious nature serves a purpose in the documentary, implying that it adds value to the film.\n\n3. **"that gives added clout to this doc"**: The term "added clout" is positive, indicating that the drama contributed by the title character enhances the documentary\'s impact or credibility.\n\nGiven these points, the review is not entirely negative because the obnoxious character is seen as contributing positively to the documentary. However, the choice of words like "obnoxious" introduces a negative tone. The overall sentiment seems to lean towards being positive because the reviewer acknowledges that the character\'s nature adds value to the documentary.\n\nConsidering the nuances, the review is more positive than negative because it highlights a beneficial aspect of the\n\nInput: no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down its components:\n\n1. **Comparison to an afterschool special**: This comparison can imply that the movie is simplistic or deals with themes in a straightforward, possibly heavy-handed manner, which is not typically a compliment in the context of film criticism.\n\n2. **Costumes by Gianni Versace**: Mentioning the designer could highlight a positive aspect of the movie, specifically its aesthetic or fashion sense. However, this is a singular positive note in an otherwise critical statement.\n\n3. **"looks better than it feels"**: This phrase suggests a disconnect between the movie\'s visual appeal and its overall impact or enjoyment. It implies that while the movie might be visually pleasing, its content, message, or execution falls short.\n\nGiven these points, the review is not entirely negative, as it acknowledges a positive aspect (the costumes). However, the overall tone leans towards being negative because it criticizes the movie\'s depth and impact, comparing it unfavorably to a simplistic genre (afterschool special) and stating that its visual appeal does not compensate for its shortcomings.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: there is a certain sense of experimentation and improvisation to this film that may not always work , but it is nevertheless compelling .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review mentions that the film\'s experimentation and improvisation "may not always work," which implies some negative aspects. However, it also describes the film as "compelling," which suggests an overall positive impression. The tone is cautious but appreciative, indicating a generally favorable sentiment with some reservations. \n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "After thoroughly examining the content of the given movie review, categorize its emotional tone by selecting one of the following options: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and insert your chosen sentiment category between the <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags to classify the review accordingly.\n\nInput: ramsay succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics , delivering a series of abrasive , stylized sequences that burn themselves upon the viewer 's memory .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: ... a lesson in prehistoric hilarity .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: combines improbable melodrama -lrb- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -rrb- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it 's looking for .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> neutral </final_answer>\n\nInput: all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:"]

😶Generated Prompts: ['To determine the sentiment of a movie review, evaluate its emotional undertones and categorize it into one of five possible sentiment labels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and then encapsulate your classification within <final_answer>answer</final_answer> to accurately reflect the review\'s sentiment.\n\nInput: spielberg \'s picture is smarter and subtler than -lrb- total recall and blade runner -rrb- , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze its emotional undertones. The review states that Spielberg\'s picture is "smarter and subtler" than other films, which suggests a positive aspect. However, it also mentions that the plot "may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences," which could be seen as a negative point. Despite this, the overall tone seems to lean towards appreciation for the film\'s intelligence and subtlety, with a cautionary note about its complexity. Therefore, the sentiment can be categorized as generally positive, but with a recognition of potential drawbacks for certain viewers.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiment label for the review would be "positive" because it highlights more strengths than weaknesses, even though it does mention a potential issue with the plot\'s complexity.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a rip-roaring comedy action fest that \'ll put hairs on your chest .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **"a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places"** - This part of the review suggests that the movie has some rough edges, typical of independent films, and it\'s somewhat self-aware of its limitations. This could be seen as slightly negative, as it highlights flaws.\n\n2. **"but has some quietly moving moments"** - This indicates that despite its flaws, the movie has moments that evoke strong emotions, which is a positive aspect.\n\n3. **"and an intelligent subtlety"** - This suggests that the movie handles its themes or storytelling with a nuanced and thoughtful approach, which is a positive trait.\n\nConsidering these points, the review acknowledges the movie\'s shortcomings but also appreciates its emotional impact and intelligent handling of themes. This balance doesn\'t lean heavily towards the negative or the very positive but suggests an overall positive sentiment with an acknowledgment of flaws. Therefore, the sentiment is not "very negative," "negative," or "very positive," but rather leans towards being positive while recognizing some limitations, which best fits the "positive" category.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: dreary tale of middle-class angst\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Assess the sentiment of a movie review by carefully analyzing its language and emotional nuances, then assign it to one of five categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - that most accurately reflects the reviewer's emotional tone, and encapsulate your chosen category between <final_answer> and </final_answer> to convey the review's sentiment.\n\nInput: some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there 's no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises ' are really surprising .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: combines improbable melodrama -lrb- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -rrb- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: `` frailty '' starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different -lrb- and better -rrb- than most films with this theme .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Evaluate the sentiment of a movie review by determining the emotional tone conveyed, which can range from very negative to very positive, and assign it to one of five categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, based on the language and opinions expressed in the review, then provide your classification within <final_answer> the determined sentiment </final_answer>, ensuring it accurately represents the reviewer\'s sentiment.\n\nInput: looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito \'s way .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe reviewer\'s sentiment is negative because the comparison to "scarface" or "carlito\'s way" is made in the context of it being a "low-budget hybrid," which implies that the movie lacks the quality or impact of those films. The tone suggests disappointment and a lack of admiration for the movie\'s production value or originality.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s a sweet , laugh-a-minute crowd pleaser that lifts your spirits as well as the corners of your mouth .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze the language and opinions expressed:\n\n1. The review mentions a "predictable storyline" and "by-the-book scripting," which are generally considered negative aspects of a film. However, these criticisms are framed as being "washed away" by other elements, suggesting that despite these drawbacks, the reviewer found the movie to be enjoyable or impressive in other ways.\n\n2. The use of "sumptuous ocean visuals" indicates a strong positive appreciation for the film\'s aesthetic qualities. The word "sumptuous" has a luxurious and pleasing connotation, emphasizing the reviewer\'s admiration for this aspect of the movie.\n\n3. The phrase "cinematic stylings of director John Stockwell" further suggests that the reviewer holds the director\'s work in high regard, contributing to an overall positive sentiment.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentiment of the review leans towards being positive. Although it acknowledges some negative aspects, the reviewer seems to believe that the film\'s strengths, particularly its visuals and direction, outweigh its weaknesses. Therefore, the sentiment is not merely positive but does not reach the level of being very positive since it does acknowledge some criticisms.\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze the language and opinions expressed. The phrase "he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities" is poetic and suggests a deep, possibly empathetic observation of the characters by the protagonist or the audience. The use of "seas of their personalities" as a metaphor for the characters\' inner worlds implies a rich, complex, and perhaps beautiful exploration of human nature.\n\nGiven this analysis, the tone seems contemplative and appreciative, indicating a positive sentiment towards the movie\'s character development or portrayal. However, the statement is brief and lacks explicit praise or criticism, which might suggest a more nuanced or subtle sentiment. Despite this, the poetic and reflective nature of the statement leans towards a positive interpretation of the movie\'s ability to portray character depth.\n\nTherefore, considering the language and the implied appreciation for character development, the sentiment of the review can be classified as positive, as it suggests an engaging and thoughtful portrayal of characters without expressing any negative sentiments.\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'To determine the sentiment of a movie review, evaluate its emotional tone and assign it to one of five categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - which represent varying degrees of emotional intensity, and then identify your selected category by placing it between <final_answer> and </final_answer> to effectively classify the review and explicitly convey its sentiment.\n\nInput: you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze its emotional tone. The review states, "you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain." This comparison implies a strong desire for the movie to end, much like the desert\'s intense need for rain. The use of such a vivid and desperate metaphor suggests a very negative sentiment towards the movie, as it indicates that the experience was tedious or unbearable to the point of yearning for its conclusion.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiment of the review can be categorized as very negative due to its expression of intense dissatisfaction or boredom with the movie.\n\n<final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze its emotional tone. The review states that the movie "sometimes makes less sense" than other action flicks it emulates, which suggests a critical or disapproving tone. This criticism implies that the reviewer did not hold the movie in high regard, at least in terms of its coherence or logic compared to similar films. Given this, the sentiment of the review is negative because it highlights a significant flaw without mentioning any redeeming qualities. Therefore, the review\'s emotional tone is best categorized as negative.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the sentiment of this movie review, let\'s analyze its emotional tone. The review mentions that the movie "engages us in constant fits of laughter," which suggests a strong positive emotional response.

The phrase "what begins brightly" suggests that the movie starts off well, but the word "bogged" implies a sense of disappointment and frustration. The mention of "over 140 minutes" adds to the negative tone, implying that the reviewer felt the movie was overly long and dragged on. Overall, the sentiment is negative, but not extremely so, as the reviewer acknowledges a positive start.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: a lively and engaging examination of how similar obsessions can dominate a family .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: when the precise nature of matthew \'s predicament finally comes into sharp focus , the revelation fails to justify the build-up .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: the film is a very good viewing alternative for young women .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze the language and emotional intensity used:\n\n1. **Language**: The review states that the film is "a very good viewing alternative for young women." The key phrase here is "very good," which indicates a positive opinion about the film.\n\n2. **Emotional Intensity**: The use of "very good" suggests a moderate to high level of praise. It implies that the reviewer holds the film in high regard, at least in the context of its suitability for young women.\n\nGiven these observations, the review does not contain extremely enthusiastic language that would suggest a "very positive" sentiment. However, it clearly expresses a favorable opinion, which rules out "neutral," "negative," and "very negative" classifications.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment of the review is best classified as "positive" because it recommends the film as a good option without using language that would indicate an exceptionally high level of enthusiasm or accolades.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: for those in search of something different , wendigo is a genuinely bone-chilling tale .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s analyze the language and emotional intensity used:\n\n1. **Language**: The review uses the phrase "genuinely bone-chilling tale," which indicates a strong, positive emotional response. The word "genuinely" adds sincerity to the statement, emphasizing that the tale is not just bone-chilling but authentically so. The term "bone-chilling" itself is a powerful descriptor that evokes a sense of intense fear or horror, suggesting that the movie had a profound impact on the viewer.\n\n2. **Emotional Intensity**: The emotional intensity of the review is high. The use of "bone-chilling" to describe the tale implies a deep emotional engagement with the movie, suggesting that it evoked strong feelings of fear, horror, or perhaps even awe. The fact that it\'s recommended "for those in search of something different" also implies that the reviewer found the movie to be unique and impactful, further indicating a positive sentiment.\n\nGiven this analysis, the review is clearly positive, as it uses strong, affirmative language to describe the movie and recommends it to viewers looking for something unique. However, the review does not use superlatives (e.g., "the best," "\n\nInput: it \'s quaid who anchors the film with his effortless performance and that trademark grin of his -- so perfect for a ballplayer .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the sentiment of a movie review by meticulously analyzing its content and then categorize it into one of five emotional tone categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, clearly indicating the classification within <final_answer>answer</final_answer> tags to represent the review\'s sentiment.\n\nInput: makes 98 minutes feel like three hours .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: there \'s a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling , but brooms is n\'t it .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down its content:\n\n1. The review starts with "there\'s a delightfully quirky movie to be made from curling," which suggests that the reviewer believes a movie about curling has the potential to be interesting and unique. This part of the sentence is positive.\n\n2. However, the review then states "but brooms isn\'t it," which indicates that the movie "Brooms" does not live up to the potential the reviewer sees in a film about curling. This part of the sentence is negative.\n\nGiven the structure of the review, it seems the reviewer is disappointed with "Brooms" because they believe a good movie could be made about curling, but "Brooms" fails to achieve this. The disappointment suggests a negative sentiment, but since the reviewer acknowledges the potential for a good movie about curling, the tone is not extremely negative.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment of the review is negative because it expresses disappointment and disapproval towards the movie "Brooms," but it does so in a manner that suggests the reviewer had some level of positive expectation for what a movie about curling could be.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: what begins brightly gets bogged down over 140 minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review states that the movie "begins brightly," which suggests a promising start. However, it also mentions that it "gets bogged down" over time, indicating a decline in quality or engagement. This phrase has a negative connotation, implying that the reviewer\'s enthusiasm waned as the movie progressed.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiment of the review can be categorized as negative, as it expresses a sense of disappointment or letdown.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Assess the sentiment of a movie review by determining the emotional tone and categorizing it into one of five sentiment categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and then provide the classification between the <final_answer> tags as <final_answer> your_sentiment_classification </final_answer> to accurately represent the review\'s overall emotional tone and sentiment.\n\nInput: wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: a fast paced and suspenseful argentinian thriller about the shadow side of play .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review describes the movie as "fast paced and suspenseful", which are positive adjectives that suggest the reviewer enjoyed the film\'s pacing and found it engaging. The phrase "argentinian thriller" is neutral, simply providing information about the movie\'s origin and genre. The phrase "about the shadow side of play" is also neutral, as it describes the movie\'s theme without expressing a clear opinion. Overall, the review has a positive tone, but since it doesn\'t use extremely enthusiastic language, I would categorize it as positive rather than very positive.\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: an impeccable study in perversity .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, "an impeccable study in perversity," we need to analyze the words and their implications. The word "impeccable" generally has a positive connotation, meaning flawless or faultless. However, it is paired with "study in perversity," which suggests a deep exploration or examination of something that is considered abnormal or contrary to what is acceptable. The term "perversity" itself has a negative connotation, implying a deviation from what is right or normal.\n\nGiven this, the review seems to acknowledge the movie\'s quality in exploring its theme (impeccable), but the theme itself (perversity) might be off-putting or negative. The overall tone could be seen as somewhat positive due to the use of "impeccable," which suggests a level of admiration for the craftsmanship or execution of the film, despite its potentially disturbing or unconventional content.\n\nTherefore, considering the balance between the positive acknowledgment of the film\'s quality and the negative implication of its theme, the sentiment could be classified as positive, because the reviewer seems to appreciate the film\'s execution or exploration of its subject matter, even if the subject itself might be considered negative or off-putting by\n\nInput: all of it works smoothly under the direction of spielberg , who does a convincing impersonation here of a director enjoying himself immensely .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: -lrb- barry -rrb- gives assassin a disquieting authority .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review mentions that the movie "-lrb- Barry -rrb-" gives the assassin a "disquieting authority." The word "disquieting" has a somewhat negative connotation, implying that the character\'s authority is unsettling or unnerving. However, the fact that the character is given authority suggests a level of respect or admiration for the performance. Overall, the tone is more positive than negative, as it highlights a compelling aspect of the movie.\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down its components:\n\n1. **"it\'s a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places"** - This part of the review suggests that the movie has some rough edges, typical of independent films, and it\'s somewhat self-aware of its limitations. The use of "tatters" and "seams" implies a sense of imperfection, which could initially suggest a negative tone.\n\n2. **"but has some quietly moving moments"** - This phrase introduces a positive aspect, indicating that despite its imperfections, the movie has moments that evoke strong emotions, suggesting a redeeming quality.\n\n3. **"and an intelligent subtlety"** - This further adds to the positive aspects, highlighting the movie\'s intelligent approach and subtlety, which are generally considered positive attributes in film criticism.\n\nGiven these points, the review balances criticisms with praises. The reviewer acknowledges the movie\'s flaws but emphasizes its moving moments and intelligent subtlety. This balance doesn\'t lean heavily towards a very negative or very positive sentiment. Instead, it suggests a generally positive outlook with an acknowledgment of the movie\'s limitations.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment of the review\n\nInput: a huge disappointment coming , as it does , from filmmakers and performers of this calibre\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the sentiment of a movie review by determining the emotional tone conveyed, which can range from very negative to very positive, and assign it to one of five categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, based on the language and opinions expressed in the review, then provide your classification within <final_answer> the determined sentiment </final_answer>, ensuring it accurately represents the reviewer\'s sentiment.\n\nInput: for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: an animation landmark as monumental as disney \'s 1937 breakthrough snow white and the seven dwarfs .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, we need to analyze the language and opinions expressed. The review describes the animation as "an animation landmark as monumental as Disney\'s 1937 breakthrough Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." This comparison to a highly acclaimed and historically significant film suggests a high level of admiration and respect. The use of the word "monumental" further emphasizes the reviewer\'s positive sentiment, indicating that the animation is considered a significant achievement in the field.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiment of the review is very positive due to the comparison to a landmark film and the use of positive language.\n\n<final_answer> very positive </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the sentiment of a movie review by determining the emotional tone conveyed, which can range from very negative to very positive, and categorize it into one of five sentiment labels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, then encapsulate your chosen sentiment category between <final_answer> and </final_answer> to effectively capture the reviewer\'s sentiment.\n\nInput: no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: the biggest problem i have -lrb- other than the very sluggish pace -rrb- is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the movie review is negative. The reviewer mentions two major problems with the movie: the pace is "very sluggish" and the main character, Esther, does not develop as an actress despite her supposed growing talent. This criticism suggests that the reviewer was disappointed with the movie\'s execution and character development. \n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: not even solondz \'s thirst for controversy , sketchy characters and immature provocations can fully succeed at cheapening it .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the movie review is negative, as it mentions that the director\'s attempts to create controversy and use provocative elements cannot "fully succeed" in diminishing the quality of the movie, implying that these attempts are seen as negative aspects. The tone is critical, but it also suggests that the movie has some redeeming value that prevents it from being completely ruined by these elements.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: dreary tale of middle-class angst\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: they \'re just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the movie review is positive, as it mentions that the movie "finds new routes through a familiar neighborhood", indicating that the reviewer appreciates the fresh take on a familiar genre. The tone is also somewhat playful, with the use of the term "copmovieland", which suggests that the reviewer is approaching the movie with a lighthearted and humorous attitude.
