Additionally, the phrase "possibly prompting audience members to wonder, \'what\'s the point?\'" suggests a subjective interpretation of how the audience might react, which is not a quantifiable or verifiable fact but rather a personal assessment.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: area k is an israeli controlled marine zone isolating the gaza strip and preventing palestinian fishermen from entering israel , egypt and international waters .\nOutput: user NOTE: The given sentence contains a mix of objective and subjective elements. The description of Area K as an "Israeli controlled marine zone" and its location relative to the Gaza Strip can be considered objective as these are factual statements that can be verified. However, the phrase "isolating the Gaza Strip and preventing Palestinian fishermen from entering Israel, Egypt, and international waters" carries a subjective tone, as it implies a negative action (isolating) and a restriction (preventing), which can be seen as an interpretation of the situation rather than a purely objective statement. Given the mix, but leaning towards the subjective interpretation, the overall sentence is categorized as subjective.\n\nInput:']

The term "diminishes none" is a subjective assessment of the film\'s drama.\n\n2. "which was always much more about human emotions than technology" - This part is also subjective because it involves a personal interpretation of the film\'s focus.

Input: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot."

1. The sentence includes evaluative language such as "ludicrous and contrived," which are subjective terms expressing the author's opinion about the plot.
2. The phrase "cultural moat" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting a barrier that is hard to overcome, which also reflects a subjective viewpoint.
3. The sentence implies a judgment about the effectiveness of the chM-bteau in overcoming this barrier, which is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal assessment.

Based on these points, the sentence is subjective.

Input: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot."

1. The sentence includes evaluative language such as "ludicrous and contrived," which are subjective terms expressing the author's opinion about the plot.
2. The phrase "cultural moat" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting a barrier that is hard to overcome, which also reflects a subjective viewpoint.
3. The sentence implies a judgment about the effectiveness of the chM-bteau in overcoming this barrier, which is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal assessment.

Based on these points, the sentence is subjective.

Thoroughly analyze the provided sentence to ascertain if it conveys an objective claim (information that is factual, impartial, and verifiable) or a subjective claim (opinions, feelings, or judgments that can differ among individuals). Decide if the text offers unbiased facts or reflects personal perspectives. Indicate your determination as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Input: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot."

1. The sentence includes evaluative language such as "ludicrous and contrived," which are subjective terms expressing the author's opinion about the plot.
2. The phrase "cultural moat" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting a barrier that is hard to overcome, which also reflects a subjective viewpoint.
3. The sentence implies a judgment about the effectiveness of the chM-bteau in overcoming this barrier, which is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal assessment.

Based on these points, the sentence is subjective.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Input: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot."

1. The sentence includes evaluative language such as "ludicrous and contrived," which are subjective terms expressing the author's opinion about the plot.
2. The phrase "cultural moat" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting a barrier that is hard to overcome, which also reflects a subjective viewpoint.
3. The sentence implies a judgment about the effectiveness of the chM-bteau in overcoming this barrier, which is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal assessment.

Based on these points, the sentence is subjective.

Thoroughly analyze the provided sentence to ascertain if it conveys an objective claim (information that is factual, impartial, and verifiable) or a subjective claim (opinions, feelings, or judgments that can differ among individuals). Decide if the text offers unbiased facts or reflects personal perspectives. Indicate your determination as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Input: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot."

1. The sentence includes evaluative language such as "ludicrous and contrived," which are subjective terms expressing the author's opinion about the plot.
2. The phrase "cultural moat" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting a barrier that is hard to overcome, which also reflects a subjective viewpoint.
3. The sentence implies a judgment about the effectiveness of the chM-bteau in overcoming this barrier, which is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal assessment.

Based on these points, the sentence is subjective.

Decide if the text offers unbiased facts or reflects personal perspectives. Indicate your determination as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Input: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot."

1. The sentence includes evaluative language such as "ludicrous and contrived," which are subjective terms expressing the author's opinion about the plot.
2. The phrase "cultural moat" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting a barrier that is hard to overcome, which also reflects a subjective viewpoint.
3. The sentence implies a judgment about the effectiveness of the chM-bteau in overcoming this barrier, which is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal assessment.

Based on these points, the sentence is subjective.

Please encapsulate your decision using the <final_answer> </final_answer> markers, adhering to the format <final_answer>objective</final_answer> or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>.\n\nInput: a very bizarre blend of reservoir dogs , fight club , unbreakable and croupier .\nOutput: userCallCheckassistantCallCheckassistant\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: even if you \'ve seen `` stomp `` ( the stage show ) , you still have to see this !\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a supernatural mystery that does n\'t know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .\nOutput: user_guidance\nLet\'s analyze the sentence step by step to determine if it is objective or subjective.\n\n1. "a supernatural mystery that doesn\'t know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama."\n   - This part of the sentence describes the movie\'s genre and its perceived indecision about its genre. The use of "doesn\'t know whether it wants to be" is a subjective assessment, as it attributes intent and indecision to the movie, which are not factual but rather interpretative.\n\n2. "it ends up being neither, and fails at both endeavors."\n   - This part of the sentence makes a judgment about the movie\'s success or failure in its genre attempts. The terms "fails" and "ends up being neither" are subjective, as they are based on personal opinion and not on verifiable facts.\n\nGiven that the sentence contains phrases that express personal opinions and judgments, it is categorized as subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: anna is followed everywhere she goes by a creepy pale assailant with a knife .\nOutput: user星巴克的咖啡非常美味。\n\nInput: originality ai n\'t on the menu , but there \'s never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence step by step to determine if it is objective or subjective.\n\n1. "originality ai n\'t on the menu" - This part of the sentence suggests a lack of originality, which is a subjective assessment. It implies that the content is not original, but this is a matter of opinion and not a fact that can be objectively confirmed.\n\n2. "but there \'s never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller" - This part of the sentence is also subjective. It expresses the opinion that the comic is exciting and never boring, which is a personal sentiment and not a fact that can be objectively verified.\n\nGiven that both parts of the sentence contain subjective assessments and personal opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the characters are so generic and the plot so bland that even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper \'s agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac , we do n\'t feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence step by step to determine if it\'s objective or subjective.\n\n1. "the characters are so generic and the plot so bland" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it expresses an opinion about the characters and plot. The terms "generic" and "bland" are subjective and based on personal views.\n\n2. "even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper \'s agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac" - This part of the sentence describes a plot element and is more objective. However, the use of "resourceful" is slightly subjective as it involves an assessment of the character\'s traits.\n\n3. "we do n\'t feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament" - This part is subjective because it expresses a personal sentiment about the audience\'s emotional response to the character and the plot.\n\nGiven that the sentence contains subjective opinions and personal sentiments, it cannot be categorized as objective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: but as the roles get bigger , the competition gets stronger , the stakes get higher , and now with an undercover thespian cop on his trail , max must struggle with his ongoing road to success and the choices he \'s made .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Input: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot."

1. The sentence includes evaluative language such as "ludicrous and contrived," which are subjective terms expressing the author's opinion about the plot.
2. The phrase "cultural moat" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting a barrier that is hard to overcome, which also reflects a subjective viewpoint.
3. The sentence implies a judgment about the effectiveness of the chM-bteau in overcoming this barrier, which is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal assessment.

Based on these points, the sentence is subjective.

🧟Generated 4 mutated prompts.
😶Generated Prompts: ['Examine each sentence in the dataset to ascertain if it conveys an objective fact (a statement that is verifiable and impartial) or a subjective opinion (a statement that reflects personal feelings, judgments, or perspectives). Thoroughly assess whether the sentence offers an unbiased fact or a personal viewpoint. Indicate your classification as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' inside the <final_answer>answer</final_answer> markers.\n\nInput: gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence: "gangs, despite the gravity of its subject matter, is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western."\n\n1. The sentence is making a comparison between the enjoyment derived from watching a film about gangs and watching a spaghetti western.\n2. The term "fun to watch" is subjective, as it reflects a personal judgment about the entertainment value of the film.\n3. The comparison to a "good spaghetti western" also involves a subjective evaluation, as what constitutes a "good" western can vary from person to person.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence conveys a personal viewpoint and cannot be considered an objective fact.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: impossible as it may sound , this film \'s heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s break down the sentence to determine if it is objective or subjective.\n\n1. "impossible as it may sound, this film\'s heart is even more embracing than monty" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it expresses a personal opinion about the film\'s emotional impact and compares it to another film (presumably "Monty Python" or a film directed by Monty Python).\n\n2. "if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition" - This part is also subjective as it interprets the film\'s portrayal of human behavior and flaws, which is a matter of personal interpretation.\n\nThe sentence as a whole expresses personal feelings and judgments about the film, making it subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: has the kitsch appeal of a farm implement on a restaurant wall , or an andy warhol mao poster : interesting , but not for its original purpose .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: shot on wide screen digibeta , sendak with his night kitchen theater partner , arthur yorinks and pilobolus artistic directors robby barnett , michael tracy , and jonathan wolken shows us the tenacity and wit that drive the creative process when serious artists work together .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this is the story of their lives , their memories , their unbending habits and the films they love .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Analyze the given text and determine if it conveys factual data or personal views, feelings, or assessments.

Thoroughly analyze the provided sentence to ascertain if it conveys an objective claim (information that is factual, impartial, and verifiable) or a subjective claim (opinions, feelings, or judgments that can differ among individuals). Decide if the text offers unbiased facts or reflects personal perspectives. Indicate your determination as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Input: gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "gangs, despite the gravity of its subject matter, is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western."

1. The sentence is making a comparison between the enjoyment derived from watching a film about gangs and watching a spaghetti western.
2. The term "fun to watch" is subjective, as it reflects a personal judgment about the entertainment value of the film.
3. The comparison to a "good spaghetti western" also involves a subjective evaluation, as what constitutes a "good" western can vary from person to person.

Given these points, the sentence conveys a personal viewpoint and cannot be considered an objective fact.

Input: impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .
Output: user
Let's break down the sentence to determine if it is objective or subjective.

1. "impossible as it may sound, this film's heart is even more embracing than monty" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it expresses a personal opinion about the film's emotional impact and compares it to another film (presumably "Monty Python" or a film directed by Monty Python).

2. "if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition" - This part is also subjective as it interprets the film's portrayal of human behavior and flaws, which is a matter of personal interpretation.

The sentence as a whole expresses personal feelings and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot."

1. The sentence includes evaluative language such as "ludicrous and contrived," which are subjective terms expressing the author's opinion about the plot.
2. The phrase "cultural moat" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting a barrier that is hard to overcome, which also reflects a subjective viewpoint.
3. The sentence implies a judgment about the effectiveness of the chM-bteau in overcoming this barrier, which is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal assessment.

Based on these points, the sentence is subjective.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Indicate your classification as either 'subjective' or 'objective' inside the <final_answer>answer</final_answer> markers.

Input: gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: "gangs, despite the gravity of its subject matter, is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western."

1. The sentence is making a comparison between the enjoyment derived from watching a film about gangs and watching a spaghetti western.
2. The term "fun to watch" is subjective, as it reflects a personal judgment about the entertainment value of the film.
3. The comparison to a "good spaghetti western" also involves a subjective evaluation, as what constitutes a "good" western can vary from person to person.

Given these points, the sentence conveys a personal viewpoint and cannot be considered an objective fact.

<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>

Input: impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .
Output: user
Let's break down the sentence to determine if it is objective or subjective.

1. "impossible as it may sound, this film's heart is even more embracing than monty" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it expresses a personal opinion about the film's emotional impact and compares it to another film (presumably "Monty Python" or a film directed by Monty Python).

2. "if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition" - This part is also subjective as it interprets the film's portrayal of human behavior and flaws, which is a matter of personal interpretation.

The sentence as a whole expresses personal feelings and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Denote your categorization as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\' within the <final_answer>classification</final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence provided:\n\n"the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure."\n\nThis sentence is making a statement about the values that have kept the Enterprise crew together. It mentions specific values such as courage, self-sacrifice, and patience under pressure. However, the statement is not presenting a verifiable fact but rather an interpretation or assessment of the crew\'s behavior and the qualities that have sustained them. The use of terms like "values," "held together," and "adventures and perils" suggests a subjective evaluation of the crew\'s experiences and attributes.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: brad , an art student hoping to win a prestigious fellowship , finds his life and career turned upside down when he falls for a faculty member at his college , lisa ducharme , who just happens to be his girlfriend \'s thesis adviser . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: disturbing for its unabashed honesty , our cast of characters both love and despise each other , their very actions acknowledging the pressures inherent in a tightly bonded peer group .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: shot on wide screen digibeta , sendak with his night kitchen theater partner , arthur yorinks and pilobolus artistic directors robby barnett , michael tracy , and jonathan wolken shows us the tenacity and wit that drive the creative process when serious artists work together .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle .\nOutput: user\nThe sentence "Scherfig, who has had a successful career in TV, tackles more than she can handle." contains a subjective opinion. The phrase "tackles more than she can handle" is an assessment or critique of Scherfig\'s capabilities, which is a matter of personal judgment and not an objective fact.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after steve \'s job opportunity in san francisco falls through , he comes up with a plan .\nOutput: user\nThe sentence "after steve\'s job opportunity in san francisco falls through, he comes up with a plan" describes a sequence of events: a job opportunity not materializing and a subsequent action taken by Steve. While it does not provide specific details about the job or the plan, it does present a factual sequence of events without expressing any personal sentiment or bias.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: without september 11 , collateral damage would have been just another bad movie . now it \'s a bad , embarrassing movie .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: carlos works in the east village as an inker of comics , but is developing his own project he hopes to sell to a well-known publisher .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Thoroughly analyze the given sentence to ascertain if it conveys an objective fact (information that is verifiable and unbiased) or a subjective viewpoint (personal feelings, assessments, or emotions that can differ among individuals).

Therefore, this sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .\nOutput: userHeaderCodeassistantHeaderCode\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. "it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects" - This part of the sentence expresses a personal opinion about the quality and style of something, likely a movie or TV show. The use of "feels like" and "gussied up" indicates a subjective viewpoint.\n\n2. "and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes" - This is a subjective comparison that conveys the speaker\'s personal experience and opinion about the excitement level of watching the plot unfold. The comparison to watching an egg timer for 93 minutes is a clear expression of boredom and disinterest, which is a subjective feeling.\n\nGiven that both parts of the sentence express personal opinions and feelings, the sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema , only now it \'s begun to split up so that it can do even more damage .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence to determine if it is subjective or objective.\n\nThe sentence is: "the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema, only now it\'s begun to split up so that it can do even more damage."\n\n1. The sentence expresses a strong opinion about the actions of the Merchant-Ivory team, using words like "destroy" and "damage," which are emotionally charged and indicate a personal viewpoint.\n2. The phrase "everything we hold dear about cinema" is subjective, as it refers to personal or collective feelings and values.\n3. The sentence also suggests a negative impact ("do even more damage"), which is a subjective evaluation.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence is clearly expressing personal opinions and feelings, making it subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Thoroughly analyze the provided sentence to ascertain if it conveys an objective claim (information that is factual, impartial, and verifiable) or a subjective claim (opinions, feelings, or judgments that can differ among individuals). Decide if the text offers unbiased facts or reflects personal perspectives. Indicate your determination as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Decide if the text offers unbiased facts or reflects personal perspectives. Indicate your determination as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

The terms "short" and "flabby" are subjective descriptors. "Short" can mean different things depending on the context and the speaker\'s perspective. Similarly, "flabby" is a subjective term often used to describe a lack of firmness or quality, which can vary based on individual standards or opinions.\n3. The sentence does not present any factual information that can be independently verified. Instead, it conveys a personal judgment or feeling about something.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence is expressing a personal opinion or feeling rather than a verifiable fact.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Decide if the text offers unbiased facts or reflects personal perspectives. Indicate your determination as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Decide if the text offers unbiased facts or reflects personal perspectives. Indicate your determination as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

The first part of the sentence, "Scherfig, who has had a successful career in TV," is a statement that can be verified by checking Scherfig\'s career history. This part is objective.\n\n2. However, the second part, "tackles more than she can handle," is an opinion. The phrase "more than she can handle" is subjective because it involves an assessment of Scherfig\'s capabilities and the scope of her projects, which can vary from person to person.\n\nSince the sentence includes a subjective opinion, the overall statement is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wan na have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: there \'s undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there \'s nothing else happening .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence step by step:\n\n1.

The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.\n\n2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there\'s nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.\n\nGiven that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that \'s not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Analyze the given sentences to determine if they are subjective or objective.

The existence of the girlfriend, Jane, could be an objective fact, but the description of her as "beautiful" is subjective.\n3. "A publisher has picked up his first novel" - This is an objective claim as it can be verified through records or statements from the publisher.\n\nGiven the presence of the subjective term "beautiful," the sentence as a whole contains a subjective claim.\n\n<final_answer>Subjective claim</final_answer>\n\nInput: enter nick , charlie \'s best friend , who does his best to help the only way he knows how : distracting charlie with parties and girls .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: shyamalan offers copious hints along the way -- myriad signs , if you will -- that beneath the familiar , funny surface is a far bigger , far more meaningful story than one in which little green men come to earth for harvesting purposes .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Decide if the text offers unbiased facts or reflects personal perspectives. Indicate your determination as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>

Decide if the text offers unbiased facts or reflects personal perspectives. Indicate your determination as either 'subjective' or 'objective' within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. "there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term "undeniable enjoyment" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. "but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase "the fun wears thin" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

It provides specific details about the character\'s background, her emotional state, and her actions. The sentence does not express any personal feelings, judgments, or perspectives about the events or characters; it merely states what happens.

"after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it involves a personal feeling and a judgment about Hollywood\'s approach to historical truth and realism. The phrase "gets the feeling" and "typical hollywood disregard" are based on personal perception and opinion.\n\n2. "it \'s a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen" - This part is also subjective. It suggests that the entertainment value is a matter of personal interpretation and enjoyment, which can vary from person to person. The term "fiery presence" is a subjective description of Hanussen.\n\nGiven that both parts of the sentence contain subjective elements, the overall sentence is subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a corrupt cia agent ( johnny depp ) who at that time , demands retribution from his worst enemy to carry out the drug lord \'s uprising against the government .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Assess the given sentence to identify whether it presents an objective statement (a fact-based, unbiased claim that can be verified) or a subjective statement (a personal opinion, feeling, or judgment that may vary from person to person).

"a light, yet engrossing piece"\n   - This sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The terms "light" and "engrossing" are subjective and based on personal feelings or judgments about the piece\'s nature and impact on the audience.\n\n2. "lux, now in her eighties, does a great combination act as narrator, jewish grandmother and subject"\n   - This sentence contains both objective and subjective elements. The fact that Lux is in her eighties is an objective fact. However, the phrase "does a great combination act" is subjective, as it involves a personal judgment about her performance.\n\n3. "taking us through a film that is part biography, part entertainment and part history"\n   - This sentence is mostly objective. It describes the content of the film in a neutral manner.

However, the name of the school "for soft landings and easy ways out" suggests a subjective interpretation or criticism of the school\'s ethos, implying that it might be easy to succeed there. This part of the sentence is not a neutral fact but rather a subjective opinion about the nature of the school.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: they discover that the one sho stole them is a rival of the criminal , while they go to every single one of his associates to find who has them .\nOutput: user\nThis sentence describes a series of actions and relationships between characters, which are neutral and verifiable if they are part of a narrative or a factual account.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Evaluate whether the provided sentences reflect objective facts or subjective opinions. Carefully examine each sentence to determine if it presents an objective statement (a fact-based, unbiased claim that can be verified) or a subjective statement (a personal perspective, feeling, or judgment that may vary from person to person). Once you have assessed the sentences, classify them as either \'subjective\' or \'objective\'. Make sure your classification is enclosed within <final_answer>classification</final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: area k is an israeli controlled marine zone isolating the gaza strip and preventing palestinian fishermen from entering israel , egypt and international waters .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it does n\'t have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a young novelist , tormented by his family \'s history and haunted by the specter of his long-dead , more famous ancestor , falls in love with a woman , a distant relative of his ancestor , whose friends and family begin to disappear mysteriously .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: what they do n\'t know , however , is that they \'re filming near the secret hideout of slobodan pavle , a serbian war criminal .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after leoncio \'s death , robert feels terribly sorry for annie especially when he discovers that she is suffering from schizophrenia .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director , this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit , with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentence provided:\n\n"though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director, this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit, with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter."\n\nThis sentence contains both subjective and objective elements. The part "howard demonstrates a great eye as a director" is subjective because it\'s an opinion about Howard\'s directing skills. The rest of the sentence is also subjective, as it expresses the writer\'s personal feelings about the film\'s narrative and style, using phrases like "tough sit," "undeveloped narrative," and "heavy-handed metaphors." The metaphor "to choke a horse" is also a subjective expression of the writer\'s opinion.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the film first relates the journey of afghans refugees fleeing the bombing and war around herat and other cities to take refuge in ill-equipped camps .\nOutput: user\nThe sentence describes a narrative element of a film focusing on the journey of Afghan refugees.

The sentence expresses a personal feeling or judgment about the enjoyment derived from a movie called "Nine Queens."\n2. The phrase "feeling like a dope" is subjective, as it involves personal emotions and perceptions.\n3. The statement "has rarely been more fun" is also subjective, as it involves a personal assessment of enjoyment.\n4. The enjoyment of a movie can vary from person to person, making this statement subjective rather than an objective fact.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sentence conveys a subjective opinion.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: ultimately the project comes across as clinical , detached , uninvolving , possibly prompting audience members to wonder , \'what \'s the point ? \'\nOutput: user\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Analyze each sentence to determine if it conveys an objective fact, which is verifiable and neutral, or a subjective opinion, which includes personal feelings or judgments. Your goal is to discern whether the sentences present unbiased information or personal viewpoints. Evaluate each sentence to ascertain if it communicates an objective statement (a fact-based, unbiased claim that can be confirmed) or a subjective statement (a personal perspective, sentiment, or evaluation that may differ among individuals). Your task is to categorize these sentences as either 'subjective' or 'objective'. After evaluating the sentences, classify them as either 'subjective' or 'objective', and ensure your classification is enclosed within <final_answer>classification</final_answer> tags, using the format <final_answer>objective</final_answer> or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>.
