Input: entwined with maggie 's search for hope , the film explores her interaction with her family and friends .
Output: To determine whether the sentence conveates factual information or personal opinions/feellings, we need to analyze the content.

The sentence describes a film that explores a character's interactions with her family and friends. This description is factual and objective, as it describes events and relationships without expressing personal opinions or feelings.

<final_answer>objective</final_answer>

Input: this bold and cathartic drama deserves to be experienced by those who cherish intimate dramas about individuals struggling against all odds to practice love , compassion , and forgiveness .
Output: To determine whether the sentence presents factual data or personal opinions and feelings, we need to analyze the language and content.

The sentence describes a dramatic film and its themes, using subjective language that includes personal viewpoints, feelings, and judgments. The phrases "deserves to be experienced," "cherish," "strurugling against all odds," "practice love, compassion, and forgiveness" are subjective and express personal opinions and feelings.

Therefore, the sentence is subjective.

Identify whether the sentence conveays facts (objective) or expresses opinions/feellings (subjective). Classify each sentence as objective (fact-based) or subjective (opinion-based). Provide your one-word answer within <final_answer> answer </final_answer>.\n\nInput: as fran 's requests become more peculiar , chep is thrown into increasingly bizarre situations .\nOutput: <final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: what really makes it special is that it pulls us into its world , gives us a hero whose suffering and triumphs we can share , surrounds him with interesting characters and sends us out of the theater feeling we 've shared a great adventure .\nOutput: <final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: "]

Input: this bold and cathartic drama deserves to be experienced by those who cherish intimate dramas about individuals struggling against all odds to practice love , compassion , and forgiveness .
Output: To determine whether the sentence presents factual data or personal opinions and feelings, we need to analyze the language and content.

The sentence describes a dramatic film and its themes, using subjective language that includes personal viewpoints, feelings, and judgments. The phrases "deserves to be experienced," "cherish," "strurugling against all odds," "practice love, compassion, and forgiveness" are subjective and express personal opinions and feelings.

Decide if the sentence conveies objective statements (factual, unbiased information that can be verified) or subjective statements (personal opinions, judgments, or emotions that may vary from person to person). Identify whether the sentence conveays facts (objective) or expresses opinions or feelings (subjective). Format your answer as <final_answer>your_answer</final_answer>.

Output: To determine whether the sentence presents factual data or personal opinions and feelings, we need to analyze the language and content.

The sentence describes a dramatic film and its themes, using subjective language that includes personal viewpoints, feelings, and judgments. The phrases "deserves to be experienced," "cherish," "strurugling against all odds," "practice love, compassion, and forgiveness" are subjective and express personal opinions and feelings.

Therefore, the sentence is subjective.

Output: To determine whether the sentence presents factual data or personal opinions and feelings, we need to analyze the language and content.

The sentence describes a dramatic film and its themes, using subjective language that includes personal viewpoints, feelings, and judgments. The phrases "deserves to be experienced," "cherish," "strurugling against all odds," "practice love, compassion, and forgiveness" are subjective and express personal opinions and feelings.

Therefore, the sentence is subjective.

Input: entwined with maggie 's search for hope , the film explores her interaction with her family and friends .
Output: To determine whether the sentence conveates factual information or personal opinions/feellings, we need to analyze the content.

The sentence describes a film that explores a character's interactions with her family and friends. This description is factual and objective, as it describes events and relationships without expressing personal opinions or feelings.

<final_answer>objective</final_answer>

Input: this bold and cathartic drama deserves to be experienced by those who cherish intimate dramas about individuals struggling against all odds to practice love , compassion , and forgiveness .
Output: To determine whether the sentence presents factual data or personal opinions and feelings, we need to analyze the language and content.

The sentence describes a dramatic film and its themes, using subjective language that includes personal viewpoints, feelings, and judgments. The phrases "deserves to be experienced," "cherish," "strurugling against all odds," "practice love, compassion, and forgiveness" are subjective and express personal opinions and feelings.

Therefore, the sentence is subjective.

Input: entwined with maggie 's search for hope , the film explores her interaction with her family and friends .
Output: To determine whether the sentence conveates factual information or personal opinions/feellings, we need to analyze the content.

The sentence describes a film that explores a character's interactions with her family and friends. This description is factual and objective, as it describes events and relationships without expressing personal opinions or feelings.

<final_answer>objective</final_answer>

Input: this bold and cathartic drama deserves to be experienced by those who cherish intimate dramas about individuals struggling against all odds to practice love , compassion , and forgiveness .
Output: To determine whether the sentence presents factual data or personal opinions and feelings, we need to analyze the language and content.

The sentence describes a dramatic film and its themes, using subjective language that includes personal viewpoints, feelings, and judgments. The phrases "deserves to be experienced," "cherish," "strurugling against all odds," "practice love, compassion, and forgiveness" are subjective and express personal opinions and feelings.

Therefore, the sentence is subjective.
