It highlights flaws in the movie\'s pacing and creativity, which are negative aspects.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment expressed in the movie review is **negative**.\n\n<final_answer>\nnegative\n</final_answer>\n\nInput: paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: essentially , the film is weak on detail and strong on personality\nOutput: Based on the provided movie review, the sentiment expressed is neutral. The review mentions that the film is weak on detail but strong on personality. This balance suggests a neutral sentiment, as it neither strongly praises nor criticizes the film.\n\n<final_answer>\nneutral\n</final_answer>\n\nInput:']
