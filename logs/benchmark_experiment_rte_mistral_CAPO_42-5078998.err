[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners. Monday explained that one of Wilson's sons and grandsons -- both about 10 years old -- were abducted.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer. The government will also provide an additional 800 officers to combat organised crime and another 1,248 staff to tackle domestic violence, Rubalcaba said.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer. The government will also provide an additional 800 officers to combat organised crime and another 1,248 staff to tackle domestic violence, Rubalcaba said.

[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners. Monday explained that one of Wilson's sons and grandsons -- both about 10 years old -- were abducted.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer. The government will also provide an additional 800 officers to combat organised crime and another 1,248 staff to tackle domestic violence, Rubalcaba said.

[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer. The government will also provide an additional 800 officers to combat organised crime and another 1,248 staff to tackle domestic violence, Rubalcaba said.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee.

Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer.

[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners. Monday explained that one of Wilson's sons and grandsons -- both about 10 years old -- were abducted.

The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today\'s issue of Science. Results similar to the popular film "Jurassic park" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins.

[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners. Monday explained that one of Wilson's sons and grandsons -- both about 10 years old -- were abducted.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee.

Input: Text 1:
[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners. Monday explained that one of Wilson's sons and grandsons -- both about 10 years old -- were abducted.

MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today\'s issue of Science. Results similar to the popular film "Jurassic park" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. "Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female.", paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.\n Text 2:\nPaleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues and other scientists discovered a T Rex bone in Montana.\nOutput: <final_answer>No Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nActor Christopher Reeve, best known for his role as Superman, is paralyzed and cannot breathe without the help of a respirator after breaking his neck in a riding accident in Culpeper, Va., on Saturday.\n Text 2:\nChristopher Reeve had an accident.\nOutput: <final_answer>Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nThe Los Angeles Lakers rolled over the Indiana Pacers in Wednesday\'s the opening round game of the NBA championship series.\n Text 2:\nLakers win the championship.\nOutput: <final_answer>No Entailment</final_answer>\n\nInput: Text 1:\nMr Gregory\'s conclusion in 1994 was that the ceremony, transferred to the more convenient nearest Sunday, was dying out.

Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer. The government will also provide an additional 800 officers to combat organised crime and another 1,248 staff to tackle domestic violence, Rubalcaba said.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer. The government will also provide an additional 800 officers to combat organised crime and another 1,248 staff to tackle domestic violence, Rubalcaba said.

ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer.

[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer. The government will also provide an additional 800 officers to combat organised crime and another 1,248 staff to tackle domestic violence, Rubalcaba said.

[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners. Monday explained that one of Wilson's sons and grandsons -- both about 10 years old -- were abducted.

It is unlikely either vessel was operating its active sonar at the time of the collision, because the submarines are designed to "hide" while on patrol and the use of active sonar would immediately reveal the boat's location.  Both submarines' hulls are covered with anechoic tile to reduce detection by sonar, so the boats' navigational passive sonar would not have detected the presence of the other.

[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners. Monday explained that one of Wilson's sons and grandsons -- both about 10 years old -- were abducted.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer. The government will also provide an additional 800 officers to combat organised crime and another 1,248 staff to tackle domestic violence, Rubalcaba said.

[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners. Monday explained that one of Wilson's sons and grandsons -- both about 10 years old -- were abducted.

[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners. Monday explained that one of Wilson's sons and grandsons -- both about 10 years old -- were abducted.

[Episcopal News Service]  Several parishes and villages in Sudan's Episcopal Diocese of Mundri have fallen victim to a fresh wave of attacks by the Lord's Resistance Army, a Ugandan rebel organization whose soldiers are prolonging a two-decades-long terrorist campaign gruesomely marked by widespread massacres and child abductions. At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri. One of the slain is Wilson, a lay reader at a parish in Moba, wrote the Rt. Rev. Bismark Monday, bishop of Mundri, in a January 15 email to church partners. Monday explained that one of Wilson's sons and grandsons -- both about 10 years old -- were abducted.
