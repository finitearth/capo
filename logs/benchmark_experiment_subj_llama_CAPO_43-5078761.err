😶Generated Prompts: ['Assess the tone and content of the provided sentence to distinguish whether it presents factual information in a neutral manner or conveys personal feelings, opinions, or biases, and then classify it accordingly as either subjective or objective, enclosing your classification between <final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: heart problems force boston cop pally lamarr to retire ; he \'s in a funk and his wife charlotte sends him packing .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it \'s thanks to huston \'s revelatory performance .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan\'s XTC." The use of the word "revelatory" to describe the performance suggests a high level of admiration, which is a subjective judgment. Therefore, the sentence conveys personal feelings or opinions rather than presenting factual information in a neutral manner.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the provided sentence is analytical and evaluative, indicating a personal assessment of the film "Blood Work". The use of words like "strong" and "character-oriented" suggests a positive opinion, while the phrase "some of them verge on the bizarre" implies a slightly critical tone. The sentence does not present a purely factual summary, but rather an interpretation of the film\'s qualities.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would classify the sentence as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it conveys the author\'s personal opinion and feelings about the film rather than providing a neutral, factual description.\n\nInput:', 'Classify the sentiment of the provided sentence as either subjective, which conveys personal emotions or biases, or objective, which presents verifiable facts, and encapsulate your classification, either \'subjective\' or \'objective\', within <final_answer> tags for a clear determination.\n\nInput: will only satisfy those who ca n\'t tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: since bursting onto the music scene last year with her double platinum first album \'pie on my face \' , tildy st .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: `` sumo east and west `` is a feature documentary about americans in the ancient japanese sport of sumo wrestling .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the provided sentence is subjective, as it expresses a personal opinion and emotional tone, using phrases like "too interested in jerking off" and "bother pleasuring its audience", which convey a sense of frustration and disappointment. The language used is also informal and colloquial, further indicating a subjective perspective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: heart problems force boston cop pally lamarr to retire ; he \'s in a funk and his wife charlotte sends him packing .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Classification Task: Assess the given sentence to distinguish between objective statements, which present verifiable evidence and unbiased facts, and subjective expressions, which convey personal viewpoints, emotions, or opinions. Respond with <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if the sentence contains factual information, or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if it embodies personal sentiments or perspectives.\n\nInput: haris seems to be an all-american guy except that he creates strange installations of hanging ropes , and suffers from terrible visions- of himself as a child in afghanistan in traditional dress , of smoke and bombs , of his dead parents and the russian soldier who shot them during the soviet invasion .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the doctor also finds he has an attraction to her , despite their age difference .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: at first shocked into disbelief , amudha then expresses her determination to search out for her biological mother .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: her mother , ingrid , is a beautiful , free-spirited poet .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the sentence to discern whether it conveys factual data or emotive perspectives, and then categorize it as either objective, comprising tangible evidence, or subjective, encompassing personal viewpoints or sentiments, by placing your classification, either \'subjective\' or \'objective\', within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: maggie \'s daughter is kidnapped , forcing father and estranged daughter to work together to get her back .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence describes a plot or storyline involving a character named Maggie, her daughter\'s kidnapping, and the subsequent actions of Maggie and her estranged daughter.\n2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is narrative and does not express a personal opinion or emotion directly. It reports on events without evaluating them as good, bad, preferable, or otherwise.\n3. **Purpose**: The purpose appears to be informative, telling the reader about a story or plot, possibly from a book, movie, or TV show.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence does not express a personal viewpoint, sentiment, or emotion. It simply states a series of events without judgment. Therefore, it is more aligned with objective reporting, as it provides information without personal bias or emotional appeal.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, we need to determine if it presents factual information or expresses personal opinions and emotions. The sentence discusses the filmmaker Freundlich and his work, specifically mentioning a theme or motif that seems to be interpreted by the speaker. The use of words like "one senses" and the description of Freundlich\'s work as bearing "a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers" suggests an interpretation or analysis of the filmmaker\'s intent or themes, rather than a straightforward presentation of facts.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is expressing a viewpoint or sentiment about Freundlich\'s work, which is not necessarily universally verifiable or factual. Therefore, it encompasses personal viewpoints or sentiments.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: ethan fernier is obsessed with the horror movies of b-movie director , winston korman .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: regardless , he promises to watch over his little brother as their parents head off to a party for the night .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, we need to determine if it presents factual information or expresses emotions and personal viewpoints. The sentence "regardless, he promises to watch over his little brother as their parents head off to a party for the night" describes a specific action and situation without directly expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the situation. It reports on a promise made and an action to be taken, which can be considered factual in the context of a narrative or scenario. However, the use of "promises" and the context of watching over a sibling implies a level of care or responsibility, which could be seen as having an emotional undertone. Despite this, the primary function of the sentence is to inform about an action or decision rather than to evoke an emotion or express a personal viewpoint.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is more aligned with presenting a situation or action rather than expressing a personal sentiment or emotion. Therefore, it leans towards being objective in the sense that it reports on a scenario without overt emotional appeal or personal opinion, even though it describes a situation that involves care and responsibility, which are emotional in nature.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: bullock \'s complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided expresses a negative opinion about a person\'s performance in a film, using phrases like "complete lack of focus and ability" which indicate a personal evaluation rather than a factual report. This kind of language suggests that the statement is based on the author\'s personal viewpoint or sentiment rather than on tangible, universally verifiable evidence. Therefore, the classification of the sentence is:\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: a true story set in modern times to bring people closer to the knowledge that there is a better way .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Input: to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it 's thanks to huston 's revelatory performance .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan's XTC." The use of the word "revelatory" to describe the performance suggests a high level of admiration, which is a subjective judgment. Therefore, the sentence conveys personal feelings or opinions rather than presenting factual information in a neutral manner.

<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>

Input: for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The tone of the provided sentence is analytical and evaluative, indicating a personal assessment of the film "Blood Work". The use of words like "strong" and "character-oriented" suggests a positive opinion, while the phrase "some of them verge on the bizarre" implies a slightly critical tone. The sentence does not present a purely factual summary, but rather an interpretation of the film's qualities.

Given this analysis, I would classify the sentence as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it conveys the author's personal opinion and feelings about the film rather than providing a neutral, factual description.

The tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan's XTC."

The tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan's XTC." The use of the word "revelatory" to describe the performance suggests a high level of admiration, which is a subjective judgment. Therefore, the sentence conveys personal feelings or opinions rather than presenting factual information in a neutral manner.

The tone of the provided sentence is analytical and evaluative, indicating a personal assessment of the film "Blood Work". The use of words like "strong" and "character-oriented" suggests a positive opinion, while the phrase "some of them verge on the bizarre" implies a slightly critical tone. The sentence does not present a purely factual summary, but rather an interpretation of the film's qualities.

Given this analysis, I would classify the sentence as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it conveys the author's personal opinion and feelings about the film rather than providing a neutral, factual description.

Dick story.\n\n2. **Tone**: The tone is informative, describing a scenario without expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the events or the character\'s situation.\n\n3. **Language**: The language used is neutral, lacking adjectives or adverbs that would indicate a personal bias or emotional stance. It simply states what happens in the story.\n\n4. **Purpose**: The purpose appears to be to inform or summarize a plot, rather than to persuade or express an opinion.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence presents information in a neutral tone without expressing personal feelings, viewpoints, or biases. It describes a fictional scenario without judgment, aiming to inform the reader about the plot.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the only thing in pauline and paulette that you have n\'t seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence is subjective or objective, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence uses descriptive language such as "football field-sized" and "vibrant flowers," which creates a vivid image. The tone seems to be one of wonder or amazement, which can indicate a subjective perspective because it implies an emotional or personal reaction to the scene being described.\n\n2. **Personal Opinion or Fact**: The description of the rug as "football field-sized" and made out of "millions of vibrant flowers" is factual in the sense that it describes something that could be quantifiably observed. However, the choice to highlight this aspect and the use of "vibrant" to describe the flowers introduces a subjective element, as "vibrant" can be considered a positive or appealing adjective, reflecting the speaker\'s or writer\'s opinion.\n\n3. **Neutral Tone**: Objective sentences typically maintain a neutral tone, focusing on presenting information without emotional coloring. This sentence, while primarily descriptive, uses language that could evoke an emotional response, suggesting it\'s not entirely neutral.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence leans towards being subjective because it not only describes a scene but does so in a way that could influence the reader\'s\n\nInput: shae powell , a successful single mom , wakes up rattled from a horrible dream .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Classify the sentiment of a given sentence as either subjective, which encompasses personal opinions, feelings, or biased judgments, or objective, which presents factual information without emotional influence, and clearly denote your classification between the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags for a direct answer.\n\nInput: plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: she \'s helped along in that process by betsy wright ( pamela gordon ) , a misanthropic dog-walker in need of help with her business and struggling with her own dark past .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about the quality of "The Count of Monte Cristo" and compares it to the original novel, indicating a subjective evaluation. The use of phrases such as "all in all" and "it is okay" further suggests a personal judgment rather than a factual statement. \n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: his search soon sends him down a dangerous path . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about a costume drama, using words like "watchable," "goofy," and "lurid" that reflect the speaker\'s subjective experience and emotional response to the drama. The tone is informal and evaluative, indicating a personal perspective rather than a factual report.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: they literally bump heads one night , and become best friends .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a negative opinion about a movie, using strong language such as "moronic" and "worst movie of the year." This kind of language indicates a personal judgment rather than a verifiable fact. Therefore, the tone is subjective, reflecting the speaker\'s personal taste and emotions towards the movie.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: hired to take mr . brown to a rendezvous with the devil ( gary oldman ) , the driver soon finds himself entangled in fiendish plans .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence describes a plot or scenario, likely from a movie or book, and presents it in a neutral, factual manner without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. \n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the tone and content of the provided sentence to distinguish whether it presents factual information in a neutral manner or conveys personal feelings, opinions, or biases, and then classify it accordingly as either subjective or objective, enclosing your classification between <final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: the unluckiest man in vegas ( william h . macy ) - a guy whose bad luck is contagious - is used by the last of the old time mob run casinos to kill high rollers \' action .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it \'s actually pretty good in the first few minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the provided sentence is informal and evaluative, expressing a personal opinion about the quality of a movie. The use of phrases such as "the worse it gets" and "it\'s actually pretty good" indicate a subjective judgment rather than a neutral, factual report.

The content presents a mixed assessment, acknowledging the comedic abilities of the stars while expressing doubt about the overall impact of the film. The phrase "begs the question" introduces a critical perspective, indicating that the author is evaluating the movie\'s success. The sentence conveys a personal opinion about the movie, rather than simply stating factual information.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the provided sentence is critical and evaluative, indicating a personal opinion about the director\'s work. The use of the phrase "strictly sitcom" to describe the director\'s portrayal of "sex-as-war" implies a negative judgment, suggesting that the director\'s approach is overly simplistic or lacking in depth. The sentence does not present a neutral, factual summary of the director\'s work, but rather conveys the speaker\'s subjective opinion.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: proof that a newcomer indie filmmaker can infuse some new life into the downtrodden loser character study .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>Subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:']

The tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan's XTC." The use of the word "revelatory" to describe the performance suggests a high level of admiration, which is a subjective judgment. Therefore, the sentence conveys personal feelings or opinions rather than presenting factual information in a neutral manner.

The tone of the provided sentence is analytical and evaluative, indicating a personal assessment of the film "Blood Work". The use of words like "strong" and "character-oriented" suggests a positive opinion, while the phrase "some of them verge on the bizarre" implies a slightly critical tone. The sentence does not present a purely factual summary, but rather an interpretation of the film's qualities.

Given this analysis, I would classify the sentence as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it conveys the author's personal opinion and feelings about the film rather than providing a neutral, factual description.

Assess the tone and content of the provided sentence to distinguish whether it presents factual information in a neutral manner or conveys personal feelings, opinions, or biases, and then classify it accordingly as either subjective or objective, enclosing your classification between <final_answer> tags.

Input: to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it 's thanks to huston 's revelatory performance .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan's XTC." The use of the word "revelatory" to describe the performance suggests a high level of admiration, which is a subjective judgment. Therefore, the sentence conveys personal feelings or opinions rather than presenting factual information in a neutral manner.

<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>

Input: for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The tone of the provided sentence is analytical and evaluative, indicating a personal assessment of the film "Blood Work". The use of words like "strong" and "character-oriented" suggests a positive opinion, while the phrase "some of them verge on the bizarre" implies a slightly critical tone. The sentence does not present a purely factual summary, but rather an interpretation of the film's qualities.

Given this analysis, I would classify the sentence as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it conveys the author's personal opinion and feelings about the film rather than providing a neutral, factual description.

Conclude your evaluation by enclosing your classification within the specified markers, denoting the sentence as either <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> to indicate a personal or emotional tone or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to signify a factual and unbiased presentation.\n\nInput: it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about a movie or show, using phrases such as "it feels like" and "about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer," which convey a sense of boredom and disappointment. The tone is informal and critical, with a touch of sarcasm. The comparison to an "after-school special" and the description of the plot as "rote" also suggest a negative assessment. The language used is emotive and evaluative, indicating a subjective judgment rather than a neutral, factual report.\n\nThe sentence does not provide verifiable, factual information but instead offers a personal viewpoint, which is evident in the use of subjective adjectives like "fancy" and the pejorative tone towards the plot. The overall sentiment is negative and opinionated, making it clear that the sentence is not presenting an impartial or objective evaluation.\n\nTherefore, the classification of the sentence is: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>.\n\nInput: cruise \'s character has the tables turned on him when he is accused of a future crime and must find out what brought it about and stop it before it can happen in the year 2054 , a so-called `` pre-crime division `` is working around washington , dc .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence describes a plot scenario, likely from a movie, involving a character played by Cruise and a futuristic "pre-crime division." The description is factual in the sense that it outlines a storyline, but it does not express a personal opinion or emotion about the plot itself. The tone is informative, aiming to convey what the story is about without evaluating its quality, morality, or any other subjective aspect. Since the sentence provides information about a narrative without inserting personal viewpoints or biases, it is considered to be presenting factual information in a neutral manner.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: she is forced to approach roxie with an offer of a part in her vaudville act ( filling the gap left by her murdered sister ) , but roxie turns down her offer flat , thinking she needs no support in topping the bill .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` my dinner with ovitz `` is a pithy , yet epicurean tale of broken dreams , broken hollywood power brokers ( and broken knees ) .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the sentiment and substance of the given sentence to determine whether it conveys impartial, evidence-based information or expresses a personal perspective, emotion, or prejudice, and then label it as either subjective, which includes opinions, sentiments, or biases, or objective, which presents factual, unbiased data in a neutral tone, and encapsulate your evaluation in a single word - either "subjective" or "objective" - within the <final_answer> tags, thereby distinguishing between fact and opinion.\n\nInput: through the guidance of his doctor , he confronts his painful past and begins a quest to find the family he never knew .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: deep in the blue ridge mountains , just outside of a small , quiet town , lives willy , an animalistic , southern rebel .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this is n\'t a terrible film by any means , but it \'s also far from being a realized work .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal evaluation of a film, using phrases such as "not a terrible film" and "far from being a realized work," which indicate a subjective judgment rather than a factual, unbiased assessment.

This implies a critical assessment rather than a purely factual report. The phrase "done by the numbers" suggests a lack of originality or creativity, which is a subjective judgment. The mention of "involved talent" and the overall tone of the sentence convey a sense of disappointment or underwhelmed expectation, further indicating a personal viewpoint.\n\nThe use of the word "generic" to describe the movie\'s virtues also implies a comparison to some standard or expectation, which is subjective. The sentence does not provide specific, verifiable facts about the movie, such as its plot, release date, or box office performance, that would be characteristic of an objective report.\n\nTherefore, the sentence embodies personal sentiments and emotional undertones, making it a subjective evaluation rather than an objective, fact-based description.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:']
