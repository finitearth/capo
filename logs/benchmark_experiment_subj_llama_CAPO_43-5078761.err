😶Generated Prompts: ['Assess the tone and content of the provided sentence to distinguish whether it presents factual information in a neutral manner or conveys personal feelings, opinions, or biases, and then classify it accordingly as either subjective or objective, enclosing your classification between <final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: heart problems force boston cop pally lamarr to retire ; he \'s in a funk and his wife charlotte sends him packing .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it \'s thanks to huston \'s revelatory performance .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan\'s XTC." The use of the word "revelatory" to describe the performance suggests a high level of admiration, which is a subjective judgment. Therefore, the sentence conveys personal feelings or opinions rather than presenting factual information in a neutral manner.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the provided sentence is analytical and evaluative, indicating a personal assessment of the film "Blood Work". The use of words like "strong" and "character-oriented" suggests a positive opinion, while the phrase "some of them verge on the bizarre" implies a slightly critical tone. The sentence does not present a purely factual summary, but rather an interpretation of the film\'s qualities.\n\nGiven this analysis, I would classify the sentence as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it conveys the author\'s personal opinion and feelings about the film rather than providing a neutral, factual description.\n\nInput:', 'Classify the sentiment of the provided sentence as either subjective, which conveys personal emotions or biases, or objective, which presents verifiable facts, and encapsulate your classification, either \'subjective\' or \'objective\', within <final_answer> tags for a clear determination.\n\nInput: will only satisfy those who ca n\'t tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: since bursting onto the music scene last year with her double platinum first album \'pie on my face \' , tildy st .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: `` sumo east and west `` is a feature documentary about americans in the ancient japanese sport of sumo wrestling .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s too interested in jerking off in all its byzantine incarnations to bother pleasuring its audience .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the provided sentence is subjective, as it expresses a personal opinion and emotional tone, using phrases like "too interested in jerking off" and "bother pleasuring its audience", which convey a sense of frustration and disappointment. The language used is also informal and colloquial, further indicating a subjective perspective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: heart problems force boston cop pally lamarr to retire ; he \'s in a funk and his wife charlotte sends him packing .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Classification Task: Assess the given sentence to distinguish between objective statements, which present verifiable evidence and unbiased facts, and subjective expressions, which convey personal viewpoints, emotions, or opinions. Respond with <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if the sentence contains factual information, or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if it embodies personal sentiments or perspectives.\n\nInput: haris seems to be an all-american guy except that he creates strange installations of hanging ropes , and suffers from terrible visions- of himself as a child in afghanistan in traditional dress , of smoke and bombs , of his dead parents and the russian soldier who shot them during the soviet invasion .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the doctor also finds he has an attraction to her , despite their age difference .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: at first shocked into disbelief , amudha then expresses her determination to search out for her biological mother .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: her mother , ingrid , is a beautiful , free-spirited poet .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the sentence to discern whether it conveys factual data or emotive perspectives, and then categorize it as either objective, comprising tangible evidence, or subjective, encompassing personal viewpoints or sentiments, by placing your classification, either \'subjective\' or \'objective\', within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: maggie \'s daughter is kidnapped , forcing father and estranged daughter to work together to get her back .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Content**: The sentence describes a plot or storyline involving a character named Maggie, her daughter\'s kidnapping, and the subsequent actions of Maggie and her estranged daughter.\n2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is narrative and does not express a personal opinion or emotion directly. It reports on events without evaluating them as good, bad, preferable, or otherwise.\n3. **Purpose**: The purpose appears to be informative, telling the reader about a story or plot, possibly from a book, movie, or TV show.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence does not express a personal viewpoint, sentiment, or emotion. It simply states a series of events without judgment. Therefore, it is more aligned with objective reporting, as it provides information without personal bias or emotional appeal.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: one senses in world traveler and in his earlier film that freundlich bears a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers , and circles it obsessively , without making contact .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, we need to determine if it presents factual information or expresses personal opinions and emotions. The sentence discusses the filmmaker Freundlich and his work, specifically mentioning a theme or motif that seems to be interpreted by the speaker. The use of words like "one senses" and the description of Freundlich\'s work as bearing "a grievous but obscure complaint against fathers" suggests an interpretation or analysis of the filmmaker\'s intent or themes, rather than a straightforward presentation of facts.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is expressing a viewpoint or sentiment about Freundlich\'s work, which is not necessarily universally verifiable or factual. Therefore, it encompasses personal viewpoints or sentiments.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: ethan fernier is obsessed with the horror movies of b-movie director , winston korman .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: regardless , he promises to watch over his little brother as their parents head off to a party for the night .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, we need to determine if it presents factual information or expresses emotions and personal viewpoints. The sentence "regardless, he promises to watch over his little brother as their parents head off to a party for the night" describes a specific action and situation without directly expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the situation. It reports on a promise made and an action to be taken, which can be considered factual in the context of a narrative or scenario. However, the use of "promises" and the context of watching over a sibling implies a level of care or responsibility, which could be seen as having an emotional undertone. Despite this, the primary function of the sentence is to inform about an action or decision rather than to evoke an emotion or express a personal viewpoint.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is more aligned with presenting a situation or action rather than expressing a personal sentiment or emotion. Therefore, it leans towards being objective in the sense that it reports on a scenario without overt emotional appeal or personal opinion, even though it describes a situation that involves care and responsibility, which are emotional in nature.\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: bullock \'s complete lack of focus and ability quickly derails the film\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided expresses a negative opinion about a person\'s performance in a film, using phrases like "complete lack of focus and ability" which indicate a personal evaluation rather than a factual report. This kind of language suggests that the statement is based on the author\'s personal viewpoint or sentiment rather than on tangible, universally verifiable evidence. Therefore, the classification of the sentence is:\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: a true story set in modern times to bring people closer to the knowledge that there is a better way .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Input: to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it 's thanks to huston 's revelatory performance .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan's XTC." The use of the word "revelatory" to describe the performance suggests a high level of admiration, which is a subjective judgment. Therefore, the sentence conveys personal feelings or opinions rather than presenting factual information in a neutral manner.

<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>

Input: for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The tone of the provided sentence is analytical and evaluative, indicating a personal assessment of the film "Blood Work". The use of words like "strong" and "character-oriented" suggests a positive opinion, while the phrase "some of them verge on the bizarre" implies a slightly critical tone. The sentence does not present a purely factual summary, but rather an interpretation of the film's qualities.

Given this analysis, I would classify the sentence as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it conveys the author's personal opinion and feelings about the film rather than providing a neutral, factual description.

The tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan's XTC."

The tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan's XTC." The use of the word "revelatory" to describe the performance suggests a high level of admiration, which is a subjective judgment. Therefore, the sentence conveys personal feelings or opinions rather than presenting factual information in a neutral manner.

The tone of the provided sentence is analytical and evaluative, indicating a personal assessment of the film "Blood Work". The use of words like "strong" and "character-oriented" suggests a positive opinion, while the phrase "some of them verge on the bizarre" implies a slightly critical tone. The sentence does not present a purely factual summary, but rather an interpretation of the film's qualities.

Given this analysis, I would classify the sentence as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it conveys the author's personal opinion and feelings about the film rather than providing a neutral, factual description.

Dick story.\n\n2. **Tone**: The tone is informative, describing a scenario without expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the events or the character\'s situation.\n\n3. **Language**: The language used is neutral, lacking adjectives or adverbs that would indicate a personal bias or emotional stance. It simply states what happens in the story.\n\n4. **Purpose**: The purpose appears to be to inform or summarize a plot, rather than to persuade or express an opinion.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence presents information in a neutral tone without expressing personal feelings, viewpoints, or biases. It describes a fictional scenario without judgment, aiming to inform the reader about the plot.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the only thing in pauline and paulette that you have n\'t seen before is a scene featuring a football field-sized oriental rug crafted out of millions of vibrant flowers .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence is subjective or objective, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence uses descriptive language such as "football field-sized" and "vibrant flowers," which creates a vivid image. The tone seems to be one of wonder or amazement, which can indicate a subjective perspective because it implies an emotional or personal reaction to the scene being described.\n\n2. **Personal Opinion or Fact**: The description of the rug as "football field-sized" and made out of "millions of vibrant flowers" is factual in the sense that it describes something that could be quantifiably observed. However, the choice to highlight this aspect and the use of "vibrant" to describe the flowers introduces a subjective element, as "vibrant" can be considered a positive or appealing adjective, reflecting the speaker\'s or writer\'s opinion.\n\n3. **Neutral Tone**: Objective sentences typically maintain a neutral tone, focusing on presenting information without emotional coloring. This sentence, while primarily descriptive, uses language that could evoke an emotional response, suggesting it\'s not entirely neutral.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence leans towards being subjective because it not only describes a scene but does so in a way that could influence the reader\'s\n\nInput: shae powell , a successful single mom , wakes up rattled from a horrible dream .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Classify the sentiment of a given sentence as either subjective, which encompasses personal opinions, feelings, or biased judgments, or objective, which presents factual information without emotional influence, and clearly denote your classification between the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags for a direct answer.\n\nInput: plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: she \'s helped along in that process by betsy wright ( pamela gordon ) , a misanthropic dog-walker in need of help with her business and struggling with her own dark past .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about the quality of "The Count of Monte Cristo" and compares it to the original novel, indicating a subjective evaluation. The use of phrases such as "all in all" and "it is okay" further suggests a personal judgment rather than a factual statement. \n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: his search soon sends him down a dangerous path . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: an often watchable , though goofy and lurid , blast of a costume drama set in the late 15th century .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about a costume drama, using words like "watchable," "goofy," and "lurid" that reflect the speaker\'s subjective experience and emotional response to the drama. The tone is informal and evaluative, indicating a personal perspective rather than a factual report.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: they literally bump heads one night , and become best friends .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: plotless collection of moronic stunts is by far the worst movie of the year .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a negative opinion about a movie, using strong language such as "moronic" and "worst movie of the year." This kind of language indicates a personal judgment rather than a verifiable fact. Therefore, the tone is subjective, reflecting the speaker\'s personal taste and emotions towards the movie.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: hired to take mr . brown to a rendezvous with the devil ( gary oldman ) , the driver soon finds himself entangled in fiendish plans .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence describes a plot or scenario, likely from a movie or book, and presents it in a neutral, factual manner without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. \n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the tone and content of the provided sentence to distinguish whether it presents factual information in a neutral manner or conveys personal feelings, opinions, or biases, and then classify it accordingly as either subjective or objective, enclosing your classification between <final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: the unluckiest man in vegas ( william h . macy ) - a guy whose bad luck is contagious - is used by the last of the old time mob run casinos to kill high rollers \' action .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it \'s actually pretty good in the first few minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the provided sentence is informal and evaluative, expressing a personal opinion about the quality of a movie. The use of phrases such as "the worse it gets" and "it\'s actually pretty good" indicate a subjective judgment rather than a neutral, factual report.

The content presents a mixed assessment, acknowledging the comedic abilities of the stars while expressing doubt about the overall impact of the film. The phrase "begs the question" introduces a critical perspective, indicating that the author is evaluating the movie\'s success. The sentence conveys a personal opinion about the movie, rather than simply stating factual information.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe tone of the provided sentence is critical and evaluative, indicating a personal opinion about the director\'s work. The use of the phrase "strictly sitcom" to describe the director\'s portrayal of "sex-as-war" implies a negative judgment, suggesting that the director\'s approach is overly simplistic or lacking in depth. The sentence does not present a neutral, factual summary of the director\'s work, but rather conveys the speaker\'s subjective opinion.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: proof that a newcomer indie filmmaker can infuse some new life into the downtrodden loser character study .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>Subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: all in all , the count of monte cristo is okay , but it is surely no classic , like the novel upon which it is based .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:']

The tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan's XTC." The use of the word "revelatory" to describe the performance suggests a high level of admiration, which is a subjective judgment. Therefore, the sentence conveys personal feelings or opinions rather than presenting factual information in a neutral manner.

The tone of the provided sentence is analytical and evaluative, indicating a personal assessment of the film "Blood Work". The use of words like "strong" and "character-oriented" suggests a positive opinion, while the phrase "some of them verge on the bizarre" implies a slightly critical tone. The sentence does not present a purely factual summary, but rather an interpretation of the film's qualities.

Given this analysis, I would classify the sentence as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it conveys the author's personal opinion and feelings about the film rather than providing a neutral, factual description.

Assess the tone and content of the provided sentence to distinguish whether it presents factual information in a neutral manner or conveys personal feelings, opinions, or biases, and then classify it accordingly as either subjective or objective, enclosing your classification between <final_answer> tags.

Input: to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it 's thanks to huston 's revelatory performance .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The tone of the provided sentence is one of praise and evaluation, indicating a personal opinion about the performance in the movie "Ivan's XTC." The use of the word "revelatory" to describe the performance suggests a high level of admiration, which is a subjective judgment. Therefore, the sentence conveys personal feelings or opinions rather than presenting factual information in a neutral manner.

<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>

Input: for all its plot twists , and some of them verge on the bizarre as the film winds down , blood work is a strong , character-oriented piece .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The tone of the provided sentence is analytical and evaluative, indicating a personal assessment of the film "Blood Work". The use of words like "strong" and "character-oriented" suggests a positive opinion, while the phrase "some of them verge on the bizarre" implies a slightly critical tone. The sentence does not present a purely factual summary, but rather an interpretation of the film's qualities.

Given this analysis, I would classify the sentence as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it conveys the author's personal opinion and feelings about the film rather than providing a neutral, factual description.

Conclude your evaluation by enclosing your classification within the specified markers, denoting the sentence as either <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> to indicate a personal or emotional tone or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to signify a factual and unbiased presentation.\n\nInput: it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about a movie or show, using phrases such as "it feels like" and "about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer," which convey a sense of boredom and disappointment. The tone is informal and critical, with a touch of sarcasm. The comparison to an "after-school special" and the description of the plot as "rote" also suggest a negative assessment. The language used is emotive and evaluative, indicating a subjective judgment rather than a neutral, factual report.\n\nThe sentence does not provide verifiable, factual information but instead offers a personal viewpoint, which is evident in the use of subjective adjectives like "fancy" and the pejorative tone towards the plot. The overall sentiment is negative and opinionated, making it clear that the sentence is not presenting an impartial or objective evaluation.\n\nTherefore, the classification of the sentence is: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>.\n\nInput: cruise \'s character has the tables turned on him when he is accused of a future crime and must find out what brought it about and stop it before it can happen in the year 2054 , a so-called `` pre-crime division `` is working around washington , dc .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence describes a plot scenario, likely from a movie, involving a character played by Cruise and a futuristic "pre-crime division." The description is factual in the sense that it outlines a storyline, but it does not express a personal opinion or emotion about the plot itself. The tone is informative, aiming to convey what the story is about without evaluating its quality, morality, or any other subjective aspect. Since the sentence provides information about a narrative without inserting personal viewpoints or biases, it is considered to be presenting factual information in a neutral manner.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: she is forced to approach roxie with an offer of a part in her vaudville act ( filling the gap left by her murdered sister ) , but roxie turns down her offer flat , thinking she needs no support in topping the bill .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` my dinner with ovitz `` is a pithy , yet epicurean tale of broken dreams , broken hollywood power brokers ( and broken knees ) .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the sentiment and substance of the given sentence to determine whether it conveys impartial, evidence-based information or expresses a personal perspective, emotion, or prejudice, and then label it as either subjective, which includes opinions, sentiments, or biases, or objective, which presents factual, unbiased data in a neutral tone, and encapsulate your evaluation in a single word - either "subjective" or "objective" - within the <final_answer> tags, thereby distinguishing between fact and opinion.\n\nInput: through the guidance of his doctor , he confronts his painful past and begins a quest to find the family he never knew .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: deep in the blue ridge mountains , just outside of a small , quiet town , lives willy , an animalistic , southern rebel .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this is n\'t a terrible film by any means , but it \'s also far from being a realized work .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal evaluation of a film, using phrases such as "not a terrible film" and "far from being a realized work," which indicate a subjective judgment rather than a factual, unbiased assessment.

This implies a critical assessment rather than a purely factual report. The phrase "done by the numbers" suggests a lack of originality or creativity, which is a subjective judgment. The mention of "involved talent" and the overall tone of the sentence convey a sense of disappointment or underwhelmed expectation, further indicating a personal viewpoint.\n\nThe use of the word "generic" to describe the movie\'s virtues also implies a comparison to some standard or expectation, which is subjective. The sentence does not provide specific, verifiable facts about the movie, such as its plot, release date, or box office performance, that would be characteristic of an objective report.\n\nTherefore, the sentence embodies personal sentiments and emotional undertones, making it a subjective evaluation rather than an objective, fact-based description.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:']

😶Generated Prompts: ['Assess the sentiment of a given statement to ascertain whether it is grounded in empirical evidence or influenced by personal feelings. Perform a detailed examination to determine if the sentence should be classified as subjective, characterized by the presence of emotional undertones, individual opinions, or prejudiced assessments, or if it is objective, marked by its basis in verifiable, unbiased facts. Your classification should be explicitly stated within the specified markers, denoted as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, to clearly differentiate between statements that reflect personal viewpoints and those that are grounded in factual information, thereby highlighting the contrast between opinion-driven and evidence-based expressions.\n\nInput: the doctor also finds he has an attraction to her , despite their age difference .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` in that sleep of death what dreams may come . . ``\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both steve buscemi and rosario dawson . . .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given statement, we must examine its components and the language used. The statement "the film was immensely enjoyable thanks to great performances by both Steve Buscemi and Rosario Dawson" contains several indicators of sentiment and opinion.\n\n1. **Emotional Language**: The use of the word "enjoyable" is subjective, as enjoyment is a personal experience that can vary greatly from one individual to another. What one person finds enjoyable, another might not. This indicates a personal opinion rather than a factual assessment.\n\n2. **Value Judgment**: The description of the performances by Steve Buscemi and Rosario Dawson as "great" is also subjective. The term "great" is a value judgment that reflects the speaker\'s opinion about the quality of the performances. In film criticism, what constitutes a "great" performance can be highly subjective and dependent on personal taste, cultural context, and individual expectations.\n\n3. **Lack of Objective Criteria**: The statement does not provide any objective criteria or empirical evidence to support the claim that the film was enjoyable or that the performances were great. It does not mention specific scenes, dialogue, acting techniques, or any other tangible aspects that could be verified or measured.\n\n4. **Personal Taste**: The\n\nInput: instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it \'s an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given statement, let\'s break it down into its components and analyze the language used.\n\n1. **"instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western"** - This part of the statement sets up a contrast between what is expected (or perhaps what has been done before) and what the subject of the statement actually is. The use of "hyperbolic" suggests an exaggeration or overemphasis, which can imply a negative judgment on the part of the speaker. "Beat-charged urban western" evokes a specific genre or style, possibly associated with energy, violence, or a particular thematic focus. The tone here seems slightly critical or dismissive of the genre being referenced.\n\n2. **"it\'s an unpretentious, sociologically pointed slice of life"** - This part presents what the subject actually is, in contrast to the expectations set up in the first part. "Unpretentious" suggests a lack of pretension or an absence of attempting to be something it\'s not, which is generally a positive attribute. "Sociologically pointed" implies that the subject has a sharp, relevant commentary on society, which suggests an appreciation for its thematic depth or insight. "Slice of life" is\n\nInput: the film \'s apocalyptic urban setting and unrelentingly icy zeitgeist is message enough without a triumphant parting shot\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given statement, let\'s break it down into its components and analyze the language used.\n\n1. **"the film\'s apocalyptic urban setting"** - This part of the statement describes a factual aspect of the film, specifically its setting. The description of the setting as "apocalyptic" could be seen as slightly interpretive, but it\'s a common descriptor in film criticism that can be grounded in observable elements of the film.\n\n2. **"and unrelentingly icy zeitgeist"** - The term "unrelentingly icy zeitgeist" introduces a more subjective interpretation. "Zeitgeist" refers to the spirit or mood of a particular time and place, which in this context is the film\'s atmosphere. Describing it as "unrelentingly icy" suggests a cold, harsh, or unforgiving atmosphere, which is an interpretation of the film\'s mood rather than a purely factual description.\n\n3. **"is message enough without a triumphant parting shot"** - This part of the statement implies that the film\'s setting and atmosphere convey a sufficient message, suggesting that the film does not need a triumphant ending to make its point. This is an opinion about the film\'s effectiveness in\n\nInput: dance teacher ramu leaves india to go to america and join his cousin who is rich and successful .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given statement, let\'s break it down into its components and analyze each part for its subjective or objective nature.\n\n1. **"an extraordinary swedish film"** - The use of "extraordinary" introduces a positive value judgment, which is subjective. What one person considers extraordinary, another might not. This indicates a personal opinion rather than a factual statement.\n\n2. **"about the soul adventure of marriage"** - This part describes the theme of the film in a poetic manner, using "soul adventure," which is an interpretative and subjective description. It suggests a deep, personal exploration of marriage, which could vary greatly from one viewer to another.\n\n3. **"the kind of intimate and character-driven film that Bille August does best"** - This statement is also subjective for several reasons. Firstly, describing a film as "intimate and character-driven" reflects a personal interpretation of the film\'s qualities. Secondly, stating that this is what Bille August "does best" implies a value judgment on the director\'s work, comparing it against an unstated standard of excellence or preference.\n\nGiven these observations, the statement is heavily influenced by personal feelings, opinions, and subjective interpretations of the film and its director\n\nInput:', 'Assess the given sentence to discern whether it presents information in a neutral, fact-based manner or if it embodies a personal viewpoint, sentiment, or bias, and subsequently categorize it as either subjective, indicating the presence of opinion, emotion, or partiality, or objective, denoting an impartial, evidence-supported, and verifiable statement, and then encapsulate your assessment within the <final_answer> tags, using either "subjective" or "objective" to differentiate between factual and opinion-based content.\n\nInput: this is the dark , moody tale of a neglected housewife who discovers she can escape her loneliness and recover a sense of interaction with her husband by having conversations with him . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: \' . . . young , savvy cinematic sensibility framed by the limitations of a conservative , unrelenting culture . \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the given sentence, we must examine its components and the implications of its wording. The sentence describes a "young, savvy cinematic sensibility" which is "framed by the limitations of a conservative, unrelenting culture." The use of the word "savvy" to describe the cinematic sensibility could imply a positive view or appreciation of the subject, suggesting a level of sophistication or awareness that is admirable. The description of the culture as "conservative" and "unrelenting" could also be seen as carrying a negative connotation, implying restrictions or limitations that are perhaps undesirable.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence does not simply state facts but includes words and phrases that convey a particular viewpoint or sentiment. The choice of adjectives like "savvy," "conservative," and "unrelenting" introduces a subjective evaluation of the situation, suggesting that the statement is not entirely neutral.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: heart problems force boston cop pally lamarr to retire ; he \'s in a funk and his wife charlotte sends him packing .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: haris seems to be an all-american guy except that he creates strange installations of hanging ropes , and suffers from terrible visions- of himself as a child in afghanistan in traditional dress , of smoke and bombs , of his dead parents and the russian soldier who shot them during the soviet invasion .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the stakes are high and the characters have to face their fears , their futures and their fellow grads as the game , and their lives , advance towards the climactic ending .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the given sentence to distinguish whether it presents verifiable facts in a neutral manner or conveys personal viewpoints, sentiments, or evaluations.

These phrases convey a critical viewpoint rather than stating verifiable facts in a neutral manner. Therefore, the classification of the sentence is:\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: boon hock comes from a low-income family and needs to balance school and helping out at the food stall .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "boon hock comes from a low-income family and needs to balance school and helping out at the food stall" can be considered as presenting information in a neutral manner without expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the situation. It states facts about Boon Hock\'s family background and his responsibilities. Therefore, it is categorized as an objective statement because it reports on circumstances without judgment.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: he \'s lost his super powers , and it will take all of bachelorman \'s skill and cunning to get his lois lane back .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: [ denis ] might be off her nut , but she can sure make an interesting film , a la davids lynch and cronenberg .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided contains phrases such as "might be off her nut" and "can sure make an interesting film," which convey personal opinions or evaluations rather than verifiable facts. The comparison to specific filmmakers like David Lynch and Cronenberg, known for their unique and often unconventional styles, further suggests a subjective assessment of the person\'s filmmaking abilities and style. Therefore, the sentence is expressing a personal viewpoint rather than presenting neutral, fact-based information.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: with a single clue to their whereabouts and nothing to lose , he leaves to find \'his people \' .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Conduct a detailed examination of the sentence\'s tone and content to discern whether it presents verifiable facts or embodies personal viewpoints.

Summarize your evaluation with a succinct classification, denoted by either <final_answer>objective</final_answer> or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, to signify whether the sentence is grounded in empirical evidence or colored by individual perspective.\n\nInput: mike leigh mainstay timothy spall deftly shades in the designated goner , fellow still crazy alum bill nighy is sweetly wispy as the capable fop , and anger-management counselor olivia williams trembles pleasantly as usual .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo examine the tone and content of the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Tone**: The tone of the sentence is descriptive and evaluative, using words like "deftly," "sweetly," "wispy," and "pleasantly." These adverbs and adjectives suggest a positive appreciation or admiration for the performances being described. The use of such language introduces a subjective element, as it reflects the writer\'s opinion or emotional response to the actors\' work.\n\n2. **Content**: The content discusses the performances of specific actors (Timothy Spall, Bill Nighy, Olivia Williams) in what appears to be a film or theatrical production. The description of their performances ("shades in the designated goner," "sweetly wispy as the capable fop," "trembles pleasantly") is interpretative, suggesting that the writer is offering their analysis or critique rather than simply stating facts.\n\n3. **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity**: Objective statements are typically neutral and based on verifiable facts. In contrast, subjective statements express opinions, emotions, or personal biases. The sentence in question clearly falls into the latter category because it expresses the writer\'s opinions about the actors\' performances, using language that is apprec\n\nInput: director joe maggio \'s riveting film is blessed with a solid cast .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo examine the tone and content of the sentence "director joe maggio \'s riveting film is blessed with a solid cast," let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Tone**: The tone of the sentence is positive. Words like "riveting" and "blessed" have strong positive connotations, indicating admiration or approval for the film and its cast.\n\n2. **Content**: The content includes an evaluation of a film and its cast. The description of the film as "riveting" and the cast as "solid" presents an assessment or judgment rather than a factual report.\n\n3. **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity**: \n   - **Objective** statements are based on facts that can be verified with evidence. They are neutral and do not reflect personal opinions or feelings.\n   - **Subjective** statements, on the other hand, express personal opinions, emotions, or biases. They cannot be proven true or false since they depend on individual perspectives.\n\nGiven the use of positive adjectives like "riveting" and "blessed" to describe the film and its cast, the sentence clearly expresses a positive opinion about the film. This kind of language indicates a personal viewpoint rather than a neutral, factual report.\n\nTherefore, the\n\nInput: they literally bump heads one night , and become best friends .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: worth watching for dong jie \'s performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo examine the tone and content of the sentence "worth watching for Dong Jie\'s performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change," let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Tone**: The tone of the sentence is positive and suggestive, indicating that the speaker finds value in watching something, presumably a film or documentary, for two reasons: Dong Jie\'s performance and its documentation of cultural change. The use of "worth watching" implies a recommendation, which is a subjective judgment.\n\n2. **Content**: The content mentions a specific individual\'s performance (Dong Jie) and a thematic element (documentation of a culture in change), which could be considered factual elements if they are indeed aspects of the film or documentary being discussed. However, the evaluation of the performance and the cultural documentation as "worth watching" introduces a subjective element.\n\n3. **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity**: \n   - **Objective elements** would include verifiable facts such as the existence of Dong Jie, the fact that the film documents cultural change, and possibly the factual aspects of the cultural change itself.\n   - **Subjective elements** include the judgment that the performance and the documentation are "worth watching," which reflects the\n\nInput: all ms . jovovich , as the sanctified heroine , has to do is look radiant , grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed while forcing open doors , wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo examine the tone and content of the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Tone**: The tone of the sentence seems to be somewhat sarcastic or critical, particularly with the use of the phrase "all ms. jovovich... has to do is look radiant, grimly purposeful and mildly alarmed." This tone suggests a subjective evaluation of Milla Jovovich\'s role or performance, implying that her actions or expressions might be perceived as limited or simplistic.\n\n2. **Content**: The content describes Milla Jovovich\'s actions in a movie, presumably, as "the sanctified heroine." The description of her actions ("forcing open doors, wielding wrenches and fleeing monsters") is factual in the sense that it reports on activities that could be part of a film. However, the choice of words ("sanctified heroine") and the overall presentation of her role suggest a subjective interpretation or critique of her character\'s portrayal.\n\n3. **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity**: The sentence is not purely objective because it does not merely report facts without any emotional tone or bias. The use of "sanctified" to describe the heroine and the sarcastic implication that her role is simplistic introduce a subjective element. Objective reporting would focus\n\nInput: \'ejemplo de una cinta en que no importa el talento de su reparto o lo interesante que pudo haber resultado su premisa , pues el resultado es francamente aburrido y , por momentos , deplorable . \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo examine the tone and content of the given sentence and determine whether it presents verifiable facts or embodies personal viewpoints, let\'s break down the key elements:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence uses phrases like "francamente aburrido" (frankly boring) and "deplorable" (deplorable), which have a negative connotation. The tone is clearly critical and disapproving.\n\n2. **Content**: The sentence discusses a movie ("cinta") and expresses a negative opinion about its outcome despite potentially having a talented cast or an interesting premise. The focus is on the subjective experience of watching the movie and the emotional response it elicited.\n\n3. **Subjectivity Indicators**: Words and phrases such as "no importa" (it doesn\'t matter), "francamente aburrido" (frankly boring), and "deplorable" are subjective judgments. They reflect the personal opinion or emotional response of the speaker rather than providing an objective analysis or factual information about the movie.\n\n4. **Lack of Objective Criteria**: The sentence does not provide measurable, objective criteria for evaluating the movie, such as box office performance, critical reception, or specific technical achievements. Instead, it relies on the\n\nInput:']

It provides information about the topic of the documentary without expressing a personal opinion, emotion, or bias. The sentence sticks to the facts and does not attempt to persuade or influence the reader\'s viewpoint.

This comparison implies a judgment of quality or ranking, which is based on the writer\'s opinion or perspective. The use of the phrase "rivals the top" suggests a subjective evaluation, as it implies a personal assessment of what constitutes "top" animations and how "visual fertility treasure planet" compares to them.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is classified as subjective because it reflects the writer\'s personal opinion or viewpoint rather than presenting a purely factual, evidence-based comparison.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: it is dawn on the morning of the vernal equinox .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: nair does n\'t treat the issues lightly . she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses an opinion about how the character Nair handles issues, using words like "lightly" and "openly and honestly" which convey a positive tone.

This description does not express a personal viewpoint, emotion, or bias directly but rather states an action and its intended consequence. However, the interpretation of the warden\'s actions as an attempt to "break" Mitra could imply a perspective on the situation. Despite this, the core of the sentence reports on events without overt emotional language or explicit personal opinion, leaning towards a factual recounting of events. Therefore, the classification of the sentence is:\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a movie that amply delivers on the epic promise of its title , entertaining , enlightening , and emboldening viewers with its deceptively simple premise and execution .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided contains words and phrases such as "entertaining", "enlightening", and "emboldening", which convey a personal evaluation of the movie\'s impact on viewers. These terms suggest a subjective experience, as they can vary greatly from person to person. The use of "deceptively simple premise and execution" also implies a personal interpretation of the movie\'s complexity. Therefore, the sentence is expressing a personal viewpoint or opinion about the movie.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s like an all-star salute to disney \'s cheesy commercialism .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is subjective because it expresses a personal viewpoint and contains a biased tone, as indicated by the use of the word "cheesy," which has a negative connotation. The phrase "all-star salute" can also be seen as sarcastic, further emphasizing the subjective nature of the statement.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided expresses a personal evaluation of a tale, using the phrases "well-shot" and "badly written" to describe its quality. These terms indicate an assessment based on personal taste or opinion rather than verifiable facts.

These expressions suggest that the statement is based on the writer\'s viewpoint or emotional response to the film, rather than on verifiable, factual data. Therefore, the nature of the sentence is subjective, as it reflects the writer\'s personal assessment or bias towards the film.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: looking aristocratic , luminous yet careworn in jane hamilton \'s exemplary costumes , rampling gives a performance that could not be improved upon .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided contains the phrase "could not be improved upon," which indicates a personal opinion or viewpoint regarding the quality of Rampling\'s performance. This kind of evaluation is based on individual taste and judgment, rather than on verifiable, factual data. Therefore, the sentence is expressing a subjective opinion.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the tone and content of the provided sentence to discern whether it presents a neutral, fact-based account or embodies personal viewpoints, emotions, or prejudices. Categorize the sentence as subjective, indicating the presence of opinions, emotional undertones, or evaluative statements, or as objective, denoting a factual, unbiased report devoid of emotional sway, and enclose your classification - either "subjective" or "objective" - within the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags for a concise evaluation.\n\nInput: \' . . . young , savvy cinematic sensibility framed by the limitations of a conservative , unrelenting culture . \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence describes a "young, savvy cinematic sensibility" contrasted with "the limitations of a conservative, unrelenting culture." The use of the word "savvy" to describe the cinematic sensibility and "conservative" and "unrelenting" to describe the culture introduces evaluative language. "Savvy" generally carries a positive connotation, implying a sense of approval or admiration for the cinematic approach. In contrast, "conservative" and "unrelenting" can be seen as having negative connotations when describing a culture, suggesting rigidity and lack of openness. This kind of language indicates the presence of an opinion or viewpoint rather than a purely factual report.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence embodies personal viewpoints or evaluative statements rather than presenting a neutral, fact-based account. Therefore, it is categorized as subjective due to the presence of words that convey a particular perspective or emotional undertone.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: provides an intriguing look at how the new economy has redrawn class lines in contemporary china .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided, "in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage," can be analyzed for its tone and content to determine whether it presents a neutral, fact-based account or embodies personal viewpoints, emotions, or prejudices.\n\nThe key elements to consider are:\n1. **"visual fertility"** - This phrase suggests a rich and vibrant visual style, which is an evaluative statement. It implies that the visuals are not just detailed but also aesthetically pleasing or impressive, which is a subjective interpretation.\n2. **"treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations"** - The act of comparing "Treasure Planet" to "the top Japanese animations" involves an evaluation of quality or standing. The term "rivals" implies a competition or comparison in terms of quality, which is subjective since it depends on personal taste or critical consensus.\n3. **"of recent vintage"** - This phrase, while descriptive of the time period, does not inherently carry subjective connotations but is part of the overall evaluative statement.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence embodies personal viewpoints or evaluative statements rather than presenting a purely factual, unbiased report. The comparison and the use of "visual fertility" introduce a level of subjectivity, indicating that\n\nInput: the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it \'s actually pretty good in the first few minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided contains evaluative statements such as "the worse it gets" and "it\'s actually pretty good," which indicate personal opinions about the quality of the movie. These phrases suggest that the speaker\'s viewpoint is influenced by their subjective experience and emotional response to the film. The use of "but" also contrasts the overall negative opinion with a positive initial impression, further emphasizing the subjective nature of the statement.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: isidor \'s tortilla heaven is the best restaurant in new mexico maybe even the world .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a raw comedy that is intermittently hilarious as it attacks pretty much every taboo around .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided contains evaluative language such as "hilarious" and "raw comedy," which indicates a personal opinion about the quality and nature of the comedy being discussed. The use of "attacks" could also imply a certain perspective on how the comedy engages with its subject matter. Therefore, the sentence embodies personal viewpoints and emotional undertones, categorizing it as a subjective statement.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb" contains an evaluative statement ("is a bomb") that expresses a personal opinion about the quality of the movie "Teacher". The use of the phrase "is a bomb" is a colloquialism that implies a strong negative opinion, indicating that the speaker does not think highly of the movie. This kind of language is subjective and emotive, rather than neutral or factual. \n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: nair does n\'t treat the issues lightly . she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence discusses the approach of a person, presumably a director or author named Nair, towards handling issues in a story or film. It mentions that she allows characters to confront their problems openly and honestly, which suggests an evaluation of her method as effective or admirable in dealing with sensitive topics. The use of the phrase "openly and honestly" implies a positive assessment of Nair\'s approach, indicating that the sentence is not merely stating facts but also expressing an opinion about the quality of her work.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence embodies a personal viewpoint or opinion regarding Nair\'s handling of issues, which means it is not a purely factual or neutral report. Therefore, the classification of the sentence is:\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:']

😶Generated Prompts: ['Assess the tone and content of a given sentence to distinguish between fact-based information and personal viewpoints. The objective is to sort sentences into two groups: those that present factual data without emotional bias and those that convey opinions, emotions, or biased perspectives. To accomplish this, analyze the language and intent behind each sentence, identifying whether it is based on personal opinion or verifiable facts. Then, label the sentence as either \'subjective\' if it includes personal opinions or emotions, or \'objective\' if it reports factual information without bias, and enclose your classification in <final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that \'s so bad it starts to become good . but it was n\'t .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal viewpoint on the movie "Deuces Wild" and its potential to become a camp adventure if it had been tweaked. The language used, such as "so bad it starts to become good," indicates a subjective evaluation of the movie\'s quality and entertainment value. The sentence does not provide factual data or verifiable information about the movie but rather conveys the speaker\'s opinion on what could have been and their disappointment that it did not reach that potential.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: [ allen \'s ] best works understand why snobbery is a better satiric target than middle-america diversions could ever be .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the tone and content of the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence uses the phrase "allen\'s best works," which implies a subjective evaluation of someone\'s (presumably a writer or artist) body of work. The comparison between "snobbery" and "middle-america diversions" as satiric targets also involves a value judgment on what makes a better subject for satire.\n\n2. **Intent**: The intent seems to be to express an opinion on what makes for effective satire, specifically why one subject (snobbery) is considered better than another (middle-america diversions).\n\n3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: The sentence includes personal opinions on the effectiveness of satire targets and the quality of someone\'s work. There are no verifiable facts presented; instead, the sentence conveys a viewpoint on what constitutes good satire and implies a critique of certain subjects as less worthy of satirical attention.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is classified as subjective because it includes personal opinions and emotional perspectives on the effectiveness of satire and the quality of artistic works.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it \'s an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: director joe maggio \'s riveting film is blessed with a solid cast .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the tone and content of the given sentence, "director joe maggio \'s riveting film is blessed with a solid cast," we need to analyze its language and intent. The key words here are "riveting" and "blessed," which imply a positive emotional response to the film. The term "solid cast" also suggests a positive evaluation of the actors\' performances. Since these descriptors reflect a personal opinion about the quality of the film and its cast, rather than stating verifiable facts, the sentence conveys a subjective viewpoint.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Sentence Classification Task: Identify whether a given sentence is subjective, which includes personal opinions, emotions, and biases, or objective, which is based on verifiable facts and unbiased information. Your task is to analyze the tone and content of the sentence to determine its classification. Label the sentence as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal viewpoints or feelings, or objective, signifying the presentation of factual, unbiased data. Ensure to enclose your classification result within the specified markers, using <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for sentences with personal perspectives and <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences grounded in factual evidence, to clearly denote the sentence\'s tone and nature.\n\nInput: he comes back , calling himself the master , and becomes a charismatic spiritual leader , running a teen shelter in hollywood .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: mike leigh mainstay timothy spall deftly shades in the designated goner , fellow still crazy alum bill nighy is sweetly wispy as the capable fop , and anger-management counselor olivia williams trembles pleasantly as usual .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: deep in the blue ridge mountains , just outside of a small , quiet town , lives willy , an animalistic , southern rebel .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: shae powell , a successful single mom , wakes up rattled from a horrible dream .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: an extraordinary swedish film about the soul adventure of marriage -- the kind of intimate and character-driven film that bille august does best .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: and what better place for romance than coney island ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: so saccharine , i \'m not sure i \'d be able to take it under normal conditions .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about something being "so saccharine" and the speaker\'s uncertainty about being able to tolerate it, which indicates a subjective viewpoint. The use of the phrase "I\'m not sure" further emphasizes the personal and uncertain nature of the statement, highlighting the speaker\'s subjective experience and opinion.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: cameroon and its peoples are the lark , its feathers plucked first by colonialism and then by native strong-men : `` alouette , je te plumerai . ``\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Conduct a thorough examination of the sentence\'s tone and content to discern whether it is objective, characterized by empirical evidence and unbiased facts, or subjective, marked by personal sentiments, emotional undertones, or partiality. Categorize the sentence as either objective or subjective based on the presence of verifiable information versus personal opinions or emotional language. Clearly denote the classification outcome within the specified markers, using <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to indicate a fact-based sentence or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> to signify a sentence influenced by personal perspective or emotional tone.\n\nInput: proof that a newcomer indie filmmaker can infuse some new life into the downtrodden loser character study .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone and content of the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence uses the phrase "downtrodden loser character study," which carries a negative connotation and implies a judgment about the type of character being discussed. The term "downtrodden" suggests a sympathetic or possibly critical view of the character type, indicating an emotional undertone.\n\n2. **Subjectivity**: The sentence expresses an opinion about the potential of a "newcomer indie filmmaker" to "infuse some new life" into a particular genre or character study. The phrase "infuse some new life" is subjective, as it implies an improvement or a positive change, which is a matter of opinion.\n\n3. **Empirical Evidence**: There is no empirical evidence provided in the sentence to support the claim about the filmmaker\'s potential impact. The statement is based on an assumption or an opinion rather than verifiable facts.\n\n4. **Bias and Partiality**: The sentence shows a positive bias towards indie filmmakers and their potential to revitalize certain character studies. This bias is evident in the positive language used to describe the potential outcome of their involvement.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence is not based on objective, verifiable\n\nInput: . . . one big laugh , three or four mild giggles , and a whole lot of not much else .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone and content of the sentence ". . . one big laugh, three or four mild giggles, and a whole lot of not much else," let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Quantifiable Elements**: The sentence mentions "one big laugh" and "three or four mild giggles," which are quantifiable, suggesting an attempt to provide specific, observable data. However, these are not presented in a strictly empirical or scientific manner but rather as a casual observation.\n\n2. **Subjective Interpretation**: The terms "big laugh" and "mild giggles" are subjective. What one person considers a "big laugh" might be perceived differently by another. The phrase "a whole lot of not much else" is also highly subjective and vague, indicating a personal assessment of the situation rather than an objective measurement.\n\n3. **Tone**: The tone seems somewhat negative or dismissive, especially with the phrase "not much else," which implies that the speaker\'s expectations were not met or that the event was underwhelming. This tone is indicative of a personal opinion rather than a neutral, factual report.\n\n4. **Emotional Undertones**: The sentence carries an emotional undertone, primarily one of mild disappointment or boredom, as suggested\n\nInput: her building \'s doorman ( newhart ) quickly shows her the ways and workings of our nation \'s capital .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a raw comedy that is intermittently hilarious as it attacks pretty much every taboo around .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone and content of the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence uses the phrase "raw comedy" and "intermittently hilarious," which suggests a positive, yet intermittent, appreciation for the comedy in question. The word "attacks" could imply a forceful or provocative approach, which might be seen as either positive or negative depending on the context, but in the realm of comedy, it often signifies boldness or edginess.\n\n2. **Subject Matter**: The sentence mentions that the comedy "attacks pretty much every taboo," which indicates a broad and potentially controversial scope of subjects. This could be seen as a factual description of the comedy\'s content, but the interpretation of what is "hilarious" and what constitutes a "taboo" can vary greatly among individuals.\n\n3. **Objective vs. Subjective Elements**:\n   - **Objective Elements**: The description of the comedy as "raw" and its targeting of "every taboo" could be seen as factual descriptions of the content, assuming these are verifiable aspects of the comedy.\n   - **Subjective Elements**: The use of "hilarious" is a subjective judgment. What one person finds hilarious, another might not\n\nInput: through the guidance of his doctor , he confronts his painful past and begins a quest to find the family he never knew .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: one of the best films of the year with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals . . . a psychological masterpiece .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone and content of the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **"one of the best films of the year"** - This part of the sentence is subjective because it expresses an opinion about the quality of the film. The term "best" is relative and varies based on personal taste and criteria for evaluation.\n\n2. **"with its exploration of the obstacles to happiness faced by five contemporary individuals"** - This portion could be seen as objective as it describes the content of the film without expressing a direct opinion. It provides information about the film\'s themes and subjects, which can be verified.\n\n3. **"a psychological masterpiece"** - This is clearly subjective. The term "masterpiece" is an evaluative term that indicates a high level of admiration or respect for the work, which is a personal judgment rather than a fact.\n\nGiven the presence of subjective language ("one of the best films of the year" and "a psychological masterpiece"), the sentence is influenced by personal opinions and emotional tone rather than being strictly factual or empirical.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Conduct a thorough examination of the sentence\'s tone and content to discern whether it is objective, characterized by empirical evidence and impartial facts, or subjective, marked by the presence of personal sentiments, emotional undertones, or prejudiced evaluations. Categorize the sentence as either objective or subjective based on its inclusion of verifiable information versus personal opinions or emotional expressions. Ensure that your classification is explicitly stated within the specified markers, denoted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences grounded in factual information or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those influenced by personal perspectives or biases, to clearly distinguish between fact-based and opinion-driven statements.\n\nInput: through the guidance of his doctor , he confronts his painful past and begins a quest to find the family he never knew .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: they \'ve all got midlife crises : clownish beav has love problems ; the intellectual shrink , henry , is slowly succumbing to the siren song of suicide ; pete is losing a war with beer ; jonesy has had weird premonitions ever since he got hit by a car .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the longer the movie goes , the worse it gets , but it \'s actually pretty good in the first few minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the given sentence is objective or subjective, let\'s analyze its content and tone:\n\n1. **Content Analysis**: The sentence discusses the quality of a movie, stating that it worsens over time but starts off well. This evaluation of a movie\'s quality is inherently subjective because it depends on personal taste, preferences, and expectations.\n\n2. **Tone Analysis**: The tone of the sentence is informal and evaluative. Phrases like "the worse it gets" and "it\'s actually pretty good" reflect personal opinions about the movie\'s progression and initial impact. The use of "pretty good" is a subjective assessment, as what one person considers "good" might not align with another person\'s standards.\n\n3. **Presence of Personal Sentiments**: The sentence contains personal sentiments, such as the disappointment or decreasing satisfaction with the movie as it progresses, indicated by "the worse it gets." This shows a personal reaction rather than an objective, factual report.\n\n4. **Emotional Undertones**: The sentence has emotional undertones, particularly a sense of initial optimism followed by disappointment. This emotional progression is a personal experience and not a fact that can be universally verified.\n\n5. **Prejudiced Evaluations**: The evaluation of the movie is prejud\n\nInput: obsessed by the world of pool , johnny ( mars callahan ) could be one of the best .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: they lie in bed but all his advances are instantly rejected by a progressively more nervous ana .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: they also talk about their professional and personal experiences , and describe the places they visit .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

The use of the phrase "still rules the epochs" suggests a subjective evaluation rather than a purely factual statement. Therefore, the tone and content of the sentence are not neutral or fact-based but rather reflective of personal feelings or opinions.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the tone and content of the provided sentence, we need to analyze its components and the language used. The sentence discusses the director\'s ability to apply "textural gloss" and criticizes their portrayal of "sex-as-war" as being "strictly sitcom." \n\n1. **"textural gloss"** - This term suggests a specific film or artistic technique, which is a factual aspect of filmmaking. The acknowledgment of the director\'s ability to apply this technique can be seen as a factual observation.\n\n2. **"his portrait of sex-as-war"** - This phrase introduces a theme or subject matter that the director is portraying, which is a factual aspect of the content being discussed.\n\n3. **"is strictly sitcom"** - The comparison of the director\'s portrayal of a serious theme like "sex-as-war" to a "sitcom" (a genre of comedy), implies a judgment or evaluation of the director\'s work. The term "sitcom" in this context suggests that the portrayal is overly simplistic, comedic, or not as profound as the theme might warrant. This judgment reflects a personal opinion or critique rather than a purely factual observation.\n\nGiven the analysis, the sentence incorporates both factual information (the director\'s technique and the\n\nInput: she \'s helped along in that process by betsy wright ( pamela gordon ) , a misanthropic dog-walker in need of help with her business and struggling with her own dark past .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: so saccharine , i \'m not sure i \'d be able to take it under normal conditions .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided expresses a personal opinion or feeling about something being "so saccharine" and the speaker\'s ability to tolerate it. The use of the phrase "I\'m not sure I\'d be able to take it" further emphasizes a personal perspective or opinion. Therefore, this sentence is not presenting information in a neutral, fact-based manner but is instead colored by the speaker\'s subjective experience or viewpoint.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: an entertaining and poignantly bittersweet take-down of a good man \'s midlife crisis .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the tone and content of the provided sentence, we must examine its language and structure. The sentence describes something as "an entertaining and poignantly bittersweet take-down of a good man\'s midlife crisis." The use of the words "entertaining," "poignantly," and "bittersweet" introduces emotional and evaluative language, suggesting that the description is not merely factual but also includes the speaker\'s opinion or emotional response to the subject matter. The term "good man" also implies a value judgment.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence incorporates personal feelings and views, making it subjective rather than a neutral, fact-based presentation of information.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: through the guidance of his doctor , he confronts his painful past and begins a quest to find the family he never knew .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "We need to categorize sentences into two groups: those that convey personal feelings or biases, and those that provide factual, unbiased information.

This kind of language often reflects a strong personal opinion rather than an objective fact.\n2. **Subjective Judgment**: The judgment that someone\'s performance "quickly derails the film" is subjective. It implies a personal opinion about the impact of the performance on the overall quality or success of the film, rather than stating a verifiable fact.\n3. **Emotional Tone**: The tone of the sentence is critical and negative, which suggests an emotional or personal viewpoint rather than a neutral, factual report.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence is best categorized as a reflection of personal feelings, views, or partiality rather than a balanced presentation of factual information.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this is n\'t a terrible film by any means , but it \'s also far from being a realized work .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal evaluation of a film, using phrases such as "not a terrible film" and "far from being a realized work," which indicate a subjective judgment rather than a factual, unbiased assessment.

It compares the availability of this film to another, "A Christmas Carol," which suggests a basis for the recommendation that is not purely factual but rather comparative and subjective. The description of Charlie Hunnam with "twinkling eyes, repressed smile, and determined face" is also subjective, as these are qualities that can be perceived differently by different people and are not objective facts.\n\n2. **Subjective Indicators**: \n   - The use of "perfect family film" indicates a value judgment.\n   - The comparison to "A Christmas Carol" implies a personal preference for Dickensian adaptations or themes.\n   - The description of Charlie Hunnam\'s appearance and its suitability for a "Dickensian hero" is a subjective assessment of his acting abilities and appearance.\n\n3. **Objective Indicators**: None are clearly present, as the sentence does not provide verifiable facts about the film\'s production, release date, awards, or any other objective measures of its quality or popularity.\n\nGiven the analysis\n\nInput:', 'Determine whether each sentence conveys a personal perspective, opinion, or emotional tone, or if it presents information in a neutral and factual manner, and then categorize it as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal sentiment or bias, or objective, denoting the absence of such influences, by placing your classification, either "subjective" or "objective", within the <final_answer>answer</final_answer> markers to clearly distinguish between sentences that embody personal viewpoints and those that offer unbiased, verifiable facts.\n\nInput: the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: while working a car insurance scam , toni cutter , a female con artist , accidentally turns a routine collision into a fatality and exposes her lawyer and lover , stephen tally , to felony murder charges from the district attorney .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Classify the sentiment of the provided sentence, distinguishing between subjective expressions that convey personal feelings, opinions, or prejudices, and objective statements that present unbiased, factual information, and then encapsulate your classification, either "subjective" or "objective", within the <final_answer> tags to denote the sentence\'s basis in either emotional perspective or verifiable evidence.\n\nInput: if deuces wild had been tweaked up a notch it would have become a camp adventure , one of those movies that \'s so bad it starts to become good . but it was n\'t .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the provided sentence is subjective, as it conveys a personal opinion about the movie "Deuces Wild" and its potential to become a "camp adventure" if it had been tweaked. The use of phrases such as "so bad it starts to become good" and the expression of disappointment ("but it wasn\'t") also indicate a personal perspective. The statement is not based on verifiable evidence, but rather on the speaker\'s emotional response to the movie.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: steers turns in a snappy screenplay that curls at the edges ; it \'s so clever you want to hate it . but he somehow pulls it off .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion about a screenplay, using phrases such as "snappy screenplay," "curls at the edges," and "so clever you want to hate it." These expressions convey the writer\'s subjective evaluation and emotional response to the screenplay. The sentence also includes a personal judgment, "but he somehow pulls it off," which further indicates the subjective nature of the statement. Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is subjective, as it presents a personal opinion rather than an objective, factual report.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: well-shot but badly written tale set in a future ravaged by dragons .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is a critique of a story, describing it as "well-shot" but "badly written" and set in a specific fictional context. The use of the terms "well-shot" and "badly written" indicates an evaluation based on the critic\'s opinion of the production quality and the script.

The language used, such as "worth watching," implies a value judgment and thus an opinion. The sentence does not present a neutral or fact-based expression but rather an evaluation of the content\'s value based on the viewer\'s potential interest in the performance and the cultural documentation.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it expresses a personal viewpoint or opinion about the worth of watching the content, rather than providing a neutral, fact-based statement.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the tone and content of a given sentence to categorize it as either subjective, which encompasses personal opinions, emotions, and biases, or objective, characterized by factual and unbiased information.

The phrase "might be off her nut" is a colloquial and subjective way of questioning someone\'s sanity or behavior, which is clearly a personal opinion. Additionally, describing someone\'s films as "interesting" and comparing them to specific directors (David Lynch and Cronenberg) is also a matter of personal taste and opinion. These elements are indicative of a subjective evaluation rather than an objective, fact-based statement.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is an evaluation of how a story or narrative has been presented, suggesting that it offers a comprehensive and possibly complex view rather than a simplified or predictable one. This assessment reflects an interpretation or opinion about the narrative structure and its impact, which can vary from person to person. The use of terms like "full world" and "pat resolution" indicates a subjective judgment about the depth and complexity of the narrative, as well as its conclusion. Therefore, this sentence is expressing a personal perspective or opinion rather than stating a verifiable fact.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: with a single clue to their whereabouts and nothing to lose , he leaves to find \'his people \' .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: merchant effectively translates naipaul \'s lively mix of characters from the page to screen .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "merchant effectively translates naipaul\'s lively mix of characters from the page to screen" can be analyzed for its nature as follows:\n\n1. **Assessment of Effectiveness**: The term "effectively" is used to describe the translation of characters by Merchant. This implies a judgment or evaluation of how well the translation was done, which can vary from person to person based on their individual tastes, expectations, and criteria for what constitutes an effective translation.\n\n2. **Description of Characters**: The description of Naipaul\'s characters as a "lively mix" introduces a qualitative assessment of the characters. The term "lively" is subjective and can be perceived differently by different readers or viewers, depending on their interpretation of what makes characters lively.\n\n3. **Translation from Page to Screen**: This part of the sentence is more about the action of translation rather than a subjective judgment. However, the overall success or effectiveness of this translation (as mentioned earlier) is subjective.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence reflects an evaluation or opinion about the quality of Merchant\'s work in translating Naipaul\'s characters to the screen. It does not present a fact that can be verified through empirical evidence without considering the subjective experience of the observer.\n\n<final_answer>\n\nInput: it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe provided sentence is an evaluation of a movie or show, expressing a negative opinion about its content and presentation. The use of phrases such as "feels like," "gussied up," and "rote plot points" indicates a personal judgment rather than a factual report. Additionally, the comparison of watching the show to "gazing at an egg timer" is a subjective and emotional response, emphasizing boredom and disinterest. The language used is figurative and critical, further suggesting that the statement is based on personal taste and opinion rather than objective analysis.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: however , ruby \'s encounters suffer from impotence and unexplained rashes .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: we \'ve seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world \'s greatest teacher .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is an evaluation of a director\'s work and the impact of the movie, which includes the opinion that the director and an actor make the audience care about the story. This assessment is based on the writer\'s personal opinion and emotional response to the film, as indicated by the phrase "makes us care," which suggests a subjective experience.\n\nThe use of the phrase "we\'ve seen it all before" also implies a personal perspective on the originality or uniqueness of the story, further indicating that the statement is subjective. Additionally, the positive tone towards the director and the actor suggests a biased assessment in favor of the film.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Input: worth watching for dong jie 's performance -- and for the way it documents a culture in the throes of rapid change .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The tone of the provided sentence is positive and suggestive, indicating a recommendation to watch something, likely a movie or documentary, for two specific reasons: the performance of "Dong Jie" and its documentation of a culture undergoing rapid change. The language used, such as "worth watching," implies a value judgment and thus an opinion. The sentence does not present a neutral or fact-based expression but rather an evaluation of the content's value based on the viewer's potential interest in the performance and the cultural documentation.

Given this analysis, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it expresses a personal viewpoint or opinion about the worth of watching the content, rather than providing a neutral, fact-based statement.

However, it\'s more about describing a characteristic rather than expressing a clear opinion.\n\n2. **"framed by the limitations of a conservative, unrelenting culture"** - This part introduces the idea of a "conservative, unrelenting culture," which can be seen as having a slightly negative connotation due to the word "unrelenting." The term "conservative" can be neutral or slightly negative depending on the context and the reader\'s perspective. The word "limitations" also implies a certain judgment on the culture being described.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence does contain elements that could be considered subjective, such as the description of the culture as "conservative, unrelenting" and the implication that these are limitations.

The tone is informal and evaluative, suggesting that the speaker\'s perspective is based on their personal understanding or experience with shaggy dog stories.

This classification is due to the presence of evaluative language such as "revelatory performance," which indicates a personal judgment or opinion about the quality of the performance. The phrase "to the degree that" also suggests a conditional assessment that is based on the speaker\'s or writer\'s viewpoint.

This perspective reflects a personal viewpoint or opinion about the evolution of the film industry, suggesting that the speaker values creativity over commercial considerations. Therefore, the sentence is not presenting information in a purely neutral or factual manner but is instead colored by the speaker\'s sentiment and belief about what makes movies valuable or worthwhile.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: deep in the blue ridge mountains , just outside of a small , quiet town , lives willy , an animalistic , southern rebel .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: we \'ve seen it all before in one form or another , but director hoffman , with great help from kevin kline , makes us care about this latest reincarnation of the world \'s greatest teacher .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe provided sentence expresses a personal opinion about the work of director Hoffman and the performance of Kevin Kline. The use of phrases such as "makes us care" indicates a subjective evaluation of the impact of the film, suggesting that the speaker\'s emotional response is being shared.

Distinguish between sentences that embody personal viewpoints, emotions, or prejudices and those that present factual, unbiased information. Assess the emotional tone and content of each sentence to establish whether it imparts neutral, evidence-based knowledge or conveys individual opinions, sentiments, or biased viewpoints. Your goal is to uncover the underlying sentiment and purpose of each sentence, deciding whether it stems from personal conviction or empirical fact. Classify the sentence as either subjective, encompassing personal opinions, emotions, or value-based judgments, or objective, which presents verifiable facts without emotional sway. Provide your classification as a single word, 'subjective' or 'objective', enclosed within <final_answer> tags, to clearly indicate the sentence's nature.

The use of "the most brilliant work" also indicates a personal opinion or subjective evaluation. The sentence does not provide verifiable evidence or factual data to support its claims but rather presents a personal perspective on the quality and impact of the works being discussed.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you \'re going to feel like you were n\'t invited to the party .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal perspective on the experience of watching a film, suggesting that without a specific connection to the subject matter (in this case, skateboarding), the viewer might feel left out or not fully included in the experience presented by the film. This feeling of exclusion is based on the viewer\'s personal connection or lack thereof to the skateboarding culture depicted in the film. The sentence implies that the film might cater specifically to those who are part of the skateboarding community, making it less relatable or enjoyable for those outside of it. The use of the phrase "feel like you weren\'t invited to the party" introduces an emotional tone, indicating that the sentence is conveying a personal sentiment rather than a factual, verifiable observation about the film\'s content or quality.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s also clear from the start that the transporter is running purely on adrenaline , and once the initial high wears off , the film \'s shortcomings start to shine through .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal perspective on the film, mentioning that it is "clear from the start" that the transporter is running on adrenaline and that the film\'s shortcomings become apparent once the initial excitement wears off. This evaluation of the film\'s quality and the timing of when its flaws become noticeable is a subjective interpretation. The use of phrases like "it\'s also clear" and "start to shine through" indicates an opinion rather than a factual report. Therefore, the sentence conveys a personal sentiment rather than presenting verifiable evidence.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: provides an intriguing look at how the new economy has redrawn class lines in contemporary china .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence appears to present an analysis or observation about the impact of the new economy on class lines in contemporary China. The phrase "an intriguing look" suggests that the sentence is introducing or summarizing a perspective or study on the topic, rather than stating a purely factual or statistical observation. The word "intriguing" itself adds a hint of interest or engagement, which can be seen as a subjective interpretation. However, the core of the sentence discusses a specific topic (the new economy and its effects on class lines in China), which could be the subject of factual study or analysis. Despite this, the overall tone and choice of words lean towards presenting a perspective or interpretation of data rather than stating a straightforward, verifiable fact.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence can be classified as presenting a perspective or viewpoint on a topic, which includes an element of interpretation or subjective judgment, rather than simply stating an objective fact.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: here , adrian lyne comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal perspective on the work of Adrian Lyne, suggesting that the speaker believes Lyne has achieved a level of profundity in his work that is likely the closest he will get to it. This evaluation is based on the speaker\'s opinion and interpretation of Lyne\'s work, rather than presenting verifiable evidence or factual data. The use of phrases such as "comes as close to profundity as he is likely to get" indicates a subjective judgment about the quality and depth of Lyne\'s work. Therefore, the sentence conveys a personal sentiment rather than impartial, factual data.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Discriminate sentences based on their emotional undertones and factual accuracy, determining whether they convey personal beliefs, feelings, or partiality, or instead offer impartial, data-driven insights devoid of emotional influence.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Assess the tone and content of the provided sentence to discern whether it presents information in a neutral, fact-based manner or if it embodies a personal viewpoint, feeling, or inclination. Utilizing your grasp of the distinction between subjective and objective language, categorize the sentence as either objective, characterized by its impartial, factual nature and absence of personal predisposition, or subjective, marked by the presence of opinions, emotions, or biases that reflect personal appraisals or sentiments. Classify the sentence as "subjective" or "objective" within the <final_answer> tags, effectively differentiating between factual information and personal opinion.\n\nInput: a documentary examining the december 2nd , 1999 assassination of microsoft ceo bill gates in los angeles , and the group of key players seeking to unravel the mystery of his alleged assassin as well as the circumstances surrounding his death .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: no worse than a lot of the crap we \'ve been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided contains phrases such as "no worse than a lot of the crap" and "slightly better than men in black 2," which indicate a comparison based on personal taste or opinion rather than a purely factual assessment. The use of the word "crap" to describe other offerings also introduces a subjective judgment, as it reflects a negative personal opinion. Therefore, the sentence embodies a personal viewpoint and feeling, rather than presenting information in a neutral, fact-based manner.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the film \'s apocalyptic urban setting and unrelentingly icy zeitgeist is message enough without a triumphant parting shot\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the tone and content of the provided sentence, we must analyze its components and the language used. The sentence discusses a film\'s setting and the overall atmosphere it conveys, describing it as having an "apocalyptic urban setting" and an "unrelentingly icy zeitgeist." These descriptions are interpretive, as the perception of a setting as apocalyptic or an atmosphere as icy can vary from person to person. The use of the word "unrelentingly" to describe the zeitgeist adds a sense of intensity that is also subjective, as it reflects the writer\'s interpretation of the film\'s atmosphere.\n\nFurthermore, the sentence expresses an opinion about the film\'s conclusion, stating that the setting and atmosphere are "message enough without a triumphant parting shot." This implies a judgment about what constitutes an appropriate or effective ending for the film, which is a subjective evaluation. The writer is essentially arguing that the film does not need a triumphant ending to convey its message, which reflects a personal viewpoint on how the film should be interpreted or appreciated.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence embodies a personal viewpoint and feeling about the film, its setting, atmosphere, and the appropriateness of its conclusion. It reflects the writer\'s opinion and interpretation rather than\n\nInput: unless you come in to the film with a skateboard under your arm , you \'re going to feel like you were n\'t invited to the party .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is an expression that reflects a personal viewpoint or feeling rather than presenting information in a neutral, fact-based manner. The use of the phrase "feel like you weren\'t invited to the party" introduces a subjective experience or emotion, suggesting that the speaker believes the film may not be inclusive or relatable to everyone, particularly those who do not identify with the culture or activity (in this case, skateboarding) depicted in the film. This kind of language indicates an opinion or personal sentiment about the film\'s accessibility or appeal to different audiences.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: deep in the blue ridge mountains , just outside of a small , quiet town , lives willy , an animalistic , southern rebel .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Classify the sentence as either subjective, which encompasses personal opinions, feelings, or biased perspectives, or objective, which presents factual information without emotional influence, and encapsulate your classification, either "subjective" or "objective", within <final_answer> </final_answer> tags for a concise determination.\n\nInput: the unexplored story opportunities of `` punch-drunk love `` may have worked against the maker \'s minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence expresses a personal opinion about the movie "Punch-Drunk Love" and its maker\'s intent, as well as the writer/director\'s talent. The use of words like "interesting" and "talented" indicate a subjective evaluation. \n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: heart problems force boston cop pally lamarr to retire ; he \'s in a funk and his wife charlotte sends him packing .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it \'s thanks to huston \'s revelatory performance .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: she \'s helped along in that process by betsy wright ( pamela gordon ) , a misanthropic dog-walker in need of help with her business and struggling with her own dark past .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: potter begins his second year at hogwarts school of wizardry , but is warned by a mysterious creature that danger awaits him at the school .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: no worse than a lot of the crap we \'ve been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal opinion by comparing and ranking the quality of certain movies, using phrases like "no worse than" and "slightly better than", which indicate a subjective evaluation.

This comparison is based on the speaker\'s perspective and interpretation, rather than on verifiable facts. Therefore, the sentiment of the statement is subjective, as it conveys a personal opinion or viewpoint rather than presenting factual evidence.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a full world has been presented onscreen , not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe statement "a full world has been presented onscreen, not some series of carefully structured plot points building to a pat resolution" conveys a personal evaluation of how a story or film has been presented. It implies an opinion about the depth and structure of the narrative, suggesting that the presentation is more immersive and less formulaic than typical storytelling. This kind of assessment is based on personal interpretation and taste rather than verifiable facts.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Assess the sentiment of a given statement to ascertain whether it relies on empirical facts or expresses a personal stance. Perform a detailed examination of the language to determine if the statement falls into the category of subjective, which includes emotional responses, individual beliefs, and prejudiced assessments, or if it is objective, comprising verifiable, impartial data. Specify your assessment outcome within the designated tags as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to denote whether the statement is based on personal opinion or factual evidence, ensuring your response highlights the difference between subjective interpretation and objective reality.\n\nInput: [ denis ] might be off her nut , but she can sure make an interesting film , a la davids lynch and cronenberg .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` a sound of thunder `` is about a game hunter ( burns ) who goes on a time-traveling safari owned and operated by kingsley \'s character to hunt dinosaurs in the prehistoric era .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: deep in the blue ridge mountains , just outside of a small , quiet town , lives willy , an animalistic , southern rebel .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: both stars manage to be funny , but , like the recent i spy , the star chemistry begs the question of whether random gags add up to a movie .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given statement, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The statement mentions that "both stars manage to be funny," which indicates a positive aspect of the movie, suggesting an element of subjective interpretation since humor can vary greatly from person to person. The phrase "like the recent I Spy" is used for comparison, which could be seen as a reference to a known entity, but the comparison itself is subjective, relying on the reader\'s or listener\'s familiarity and opinion of "I Spy."\n\n2. **Subjective Elements**: The statement contains the phrase "the star chemistry begs the question," which introduces a subjective evaluation of the actors\' performances and their on-screen chemistry. The term "chemistry" between stars is often used to describe how well actors work together, which is a subjective assessment. The question of whether "random gags add up to a movie" further introduces a subjective critique, as it implies a personal judgment on the coherence and quality of the film based on its comedic elements.\n\n3. **Objective Elements**: While the statement does reference specific elements that can be observed (e.g., the presence of gags, the performance of stars), the overall evaluation of these elements is subjective. There are no\n\nInput:', 'Determine the nature of the given sentence by categorizing it as either subjective or objective, where objective sentences convey factual, unbiased, and verifiable information, and subjective sentences embody personal opinions, emotions, or judgments. Your goal is to discern whether the sentence presents an impartial, fact-based account or an expression of personal sentiment, and then classify it accordingly. To achieve this, assess the degree to which the sentence incorporates emotional language, personal perspectives, or biased viewpoints versus factual, verifiable data. Respond with <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if the sentence is rooted in factual, unbiased information, or with <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if it reflects personal opinions, emotional undertones, or biased judgments, thereby differentiating between the presentation of verifiable facts and the expression of individual viewpoints.\n\nInput:', 'Determine whether a given sentence conveys a personal viewpoint, emotion, or bias, categorizing it as subjective, or if it presents verifiable, unbiased information, categorizing it as objective, and then clearly indicate your classification, choosing between "subjective" for sentences that express opinions or emotions and "objective" for sentences that provide factual data, by placing your chosen classification, either "subjective" or "objective", within <final_answer> </final_answer> tags to provide a straightforward answer.\n\nInput: daringly perceptive , taut , piercing and feisty , biggie and tupac is undeniably subversive and involving in its bold presentation .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence uses words like "daringly perceptive", "taut", "piercing", "feisty", and "undeniably subversive" to describe the presentation of Biggie and Tupac, which are value judgments and emotional assessments. These descriptors convey a personal viewpoint and opinion about the subject matter, indicating that the sentence is not a neutral, factual report but rather an expression of the speaker\'s or writer\'s feelings and beliefs.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: against the background of an australian desert landscape , so much space and so few people , sandy , a geologist , and hiromitsu , a japanese businessman , play out a story of human inconsequence in the face of the blistering universe .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: proof that a newcomer indie filmmaker can infuse some new life into the downtrodden loser character study .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided expresses an opinion about the potential of a newcomer indie filmmaker to bring new life to a particular genre of film, which is the "downtrodden loser character study." This evaluation is based on the use of the phrase "infuse some new life," which implies a positive change or improvement, and the overall tone suggests a hopeful or optimistic viewpoint towards the filmmaker\'s potential impact. Since it reflects an opinion rather than stating a verifiable fact, it is categorized as subjective.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: in auteil \'s less dramatic but equally incisive performance , he \'s a charismatic charmer likely to seduce and conquer .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided contains words and phrases such as "charismatic charmer" and "likely to seduce and conquer," which convey a personal viewpoint or opinion about the performance. These expressions introduce a level of bias or personal interpretation of the actor\'s performance, rather than simply stating verifiable facts.

The sentence compares something to a "vintage automobile" and describes its performance in variable terms ("sometimes runs smoothly, and sometimes lurches and sputters"), which suggests a metaphorical or figurative description rather than a strictly factual one. The use of such a comparison introduces a level of personal perspective or opinion, as the perception of how the subject (likely a process, system, or entity) performs can vary from person to person. The emotional or evaluative tone ("lurches and sputters" implies a negative experience, while "never quite stalls" suggests resilience or perseverance) further indicates that the sentence is not merely stating facts but is colored by the speaker\'s viewpoint or experience.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence embodies personal sentiments or opinions about the subject\'s performance, which aligns with the characteristics of a subjective statement.\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:']

It presents a scenario without evaluating it as good, bad, or otherwise, which suggests it is more objective than subjective.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence is classified as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> because it describes an action without expressing a personal viewpoint or emotion, focusing instead on conveying information about an event or situation.\n\nInput:', 'Assess the sentiment of the given sentence, distinguishing between subjective expressions that convey personal sentiments, emotions, or prejudices, and objective statements that provide verifiable, unbiased information. Evaluate whether the sentence presents a personal viewpoint or factual evidence, and then categorize it accordingly. Your classification should be clearly marked as either <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> to denote a sentence influenced by personal feelings or opinions, or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to indicate a sentence based on factual, impartial data, thereby determining the underlying tone of the sentence.\n\nInput: potter begins his second year at hogwarts school of wizardry , but is warned by a mysterious creature that danger awaits him at the school .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> objective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the unexplored story opportunities of `` punch-drunk love `` may have worked against the maker \'s minimalist intent but it is an interesting exercise by talented writer/director anderson .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence expresses a personal opinion about the movie "Punch-Drunk Love" and its maker\'s intent, as well as the writer/director\'s talent. The use of words like "interesting" and "talented" indicate a subjective evaluation. \n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: the doctor also finds he has an attraction to her , despite their age difference .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: provides an intriguing look at how the new economy has redrawn class lines in contemporary china .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the given sentence, "provides an intriguing look at how the new economy has redrawn class lines in contemporary China," we need to analyze its components and the tone it conveys.\n\n1. **Intriguing**: This word suggests that the subject matter is interesting or thought-provoking. The use of "intriguing" can imply a positive or engaging aspect, which might lean towards a subjective interpretation since what one person finds intriguing, another might not. However, in the context of academic or informative writing, "intriguing" can also serve to highlight the complexity or novelty of a topic without necessarily expressing a personal opinion.\n\n2. **Look at how the new economy has redrawn class lines in contemporary China**: This part of the sentence is more factual. It describes a topic of study or analysis without expressing a personal sentiment towards the changes in class lines. The phrase "has redrawn class lines" is a neutral, observational statement about the impact of the new economy.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence primarily presents an objective statement about the topic it discusses. While the word "intriguing" introduces a hint of subjective interpretation regarding the interest level of the topic, the overall sentence aims to inform about the existence\n\nInput: upper west sidey exercise in narcissism and self-congratulation disguised as a tribute .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: to the degree that ivans xtc . works , it \'s thanks to huston \'s revelatory performance .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: joanna , a good-for-nothing girl who miserably failed in her attempt to win any television game show and contest , is hired by nino as his personal secretary , believing that she could be her lucky charm .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Sentence Classification Exercise: Determine the nature of the given sentence, deciding whether it presents information in a neutral, fact-based manner or if it embodies personal perspectives, sentiments, or biased viewpoints. Classify the sentence as either objective, indicating it is rooted in tangible evidence and lacks bias, or subjective, signifying it includes personal opinions, emotional undertones, or judgmental language. Utilize the designated format, enclosing your classification in <final_answer>objective</final_answer> or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, to distinctly mark whether the sentence is grounded in empirical data or reflective of individual viewpoints.\n\nInput: they lie in bed but all his advances are instantly rejected by a progressively more nervous ana .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components and tone:\n\n1. **"in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage"** - This sentence compares "Treasure Planet" to top Japanese animations, suggesting a comparison based on the quality or appeal of visual elements.\n\n2. **Use of "rivals"** - The word "rivals" implies competition, which can be seen as a subjective interpretation since the perception of what constitutes a rival in terms of quality can vary from person to person.\n\n3. **"top japanese animations of recent vintage"** - This phrase suggests a specific, though somewhat subjective, benchmark for comparison. The term "top" is evaluative and can depend on personal taste or critical consensus, which may not be universally agreed upon.\n\n4. **Lack of specific, measurable criteria** - The sentence does not provide concrete, quantifiable reasons for why "Treasure Planet" rivals these animations, relying instead on an implied qualitative assessment.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence embodies a comparison that is based on the author\'s or speaker\'s opinion regarding the quality or standing of "Treasure Planet" relative to other animations. It reflects a personal viewpoint or judgment rather than a purely factual, data-driven\n\nInput: the director knows how to apply textural gloss , but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"the director knows how to apply textural gloss"** - This part of the sentence can be seen as somewhat objective, as it describes a skill or ability of the director. However, the term "textural gloss" might imply a specific aesthetic or stylistic choice, which could be subjective in interpretation.\n\n2. **"but his portrait of sex-as-war is strictly sitcom"** - This part introduces a comparison and a genre classification ("strictly sitcom") that is subjective. The term "sex-as-war" is also an interpretation of the director\'s work, suggesting a thematic analysis that can vary from person to person. Describing this portrayal as "strictly sitcom" further injects subjectivity, as it implies a judgment on the depth or seriousness of the portrayal, comparing it to a genre (sitcom) known for its comedic and often light-hearted nature.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence combines elements of objective description (acknowledgment of a skill) with subjective interpretation (the thematic analysis and genre comparison). The use of "but" also indicates a contrast that reflects the speaker\'s opinion on the director\'s work, further suggesting subjectivity.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is\n\nInput: `` sumo east and west `` is a feature documentary about americans in the ancient japanese sport of sumo wrestling .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence describes a documentary about Americans participating in sumo wrestling, a traditional Japanese sport. It provides information about the topic of the documentary without expressing a personal opinion, emotion, or bias. The sentence is straightforward and factual, indicating that it is based on verifiable information rather than personal viewpoints.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: will only satisfy those who ca n\'t tell the difference between the good , the bad and the ugly .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "it may be a prize winner , but teacher is a bomb" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal opinion about the movie "Teacher" using the slang term "a bomb," which is a colloquial and judgmental way of saying something is exceptionally good. The use of this phrase indicates a personal viewpoint rather than a neutral, fact-based assessment.\n\nInput: an entertaining and poignantly bittersweet take-down of a good man \'s midlife crisis .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence is <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it includes words like "entertaining", "poignantly bittersweet", which convey a personal opinion or emotional tone, rather than presenting a neutral, fact-based description.\n\nInput: those who managed to avoid the deconstructionist theorizing of french philosopher jacques derrida in college can now take an 85-minute brush-up course with the documentary derrida . or , you can do something fun tonight .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it includes a personal opinion and judgmental language, evident in the phrase "or, you can do something fun tonight," which implies a negative view of the documentary or the subject matter, and the description of the course as an "85-minute brush-up" which may carry a slightly sarcastic tone. The tone of the sentence suggests a personal perspective rather than a neutral, fact-based presentation of information.\n\nInput:']
