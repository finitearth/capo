The word "nada" itself means "nothing" in Spanish, emphasizing the lack of value or substance.\n\n2. **Tone**: The tone of the review is dismissive and derogatory. The use of "nada" to describe the movie implies a strong negative opinion, suggesting that the reviewer found the movie to be completely unimpressive or unenjoyable.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiment of the review is clearly negative.

The review states that "birthday girl does n\'t try to surprise us with plot twists" - This could initially seem negative because it implies a lack of complexity or surprise in the plot. However, the tone doesn\'t seem to condemn this aspect; rather, it presents it as a fact.\n2. The phrase "but rather seems to enjoy its own transparency" - This part of the sentence suggests that the movie\'s straightforwardness is not necessarily seen as a weakness. The word "enjoy" has a positive connotation, implying that the reviewer finds some charm or appeal in the movie\'s approach.\n\nGiven these observations, the overall sentiment of the review leans towards being positive. It doesn\'t express dissatisfaction or disappointment, which would be characteristic of negative or very negative sentiments. Instead, it highlights a unique aspect of the movie in a somewhat favorable light. However, it doesn\'t use overly enthusiastic language that would categorize it as very positive. Therefore, the sentiment is best described as positive, as it acknowledges and somewhat appreciates the movie\'s transparent approach to its plot.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico \'s most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given movie review expresses a highly favorable opinion towards the film, highlighting its ability to convey the passion, creativity, and fearlessness of the artist.

The statement "as for children, they won\'t enjoy the movie at all" directly expresses a negative opinion about the movie, specifically targeting its appeal to children.\n2. The use of "won\'t enjoy" is a strong indicator of a negative sentiment, as it clearly states a lack of enjoyment.\n3. The phrase "at all" emphasizes the extent of the negative sentiment, suggesting that there is no aspect of the movie that children would find enjoyable.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentiment of the review can be classified into one of the five distinct emotional categories as follows:\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Analyze the given movie review to determine its emotional tone, choosing from a range of sentiments that include very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive, and then encapsulate your chosen sentiment within the designated markers <final_answer>your selected sentiment</final_answer> to effectively communicate the review\'s sentiment.\n\nInput: paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review mentions that Paul Bettany is good in his role, which suggests a positive aspect.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Assess the sentiment of the given movie review, categorizing it into one of five emotional categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and enclose your chosen category between the <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags for identification.\n\nInput: one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the given movie review is very positive, as it uses the phrase "one of the most exciting" to describe the film, indicating a high level of enthusiasm and praise. \n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: romanek \'s themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early \'80s .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the given movie review can be assessed as positive, despite mentioning "cheesy dialogue", because it describes the movie as "great trashy fun" and appreciates its return to the director\'s earlier style. Therefore, the category is: \n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers , the movie is n\'t tough to take as long as you \'ve paid a matinee price .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the given movie review can be assessed as negative because it compares the movie unfavorably to other films ("neither as scary-funny as tremors nor demented-funny as starship troopers") and suggests that it\'s only worth watching if you\'ve paid a lower price ("as long as you\'ve paid a matinee price"). This implies that the reviewer did not think highly of the movie but did not completely condemn it either. Therefore, the chosen category is: \n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the given movie review is negative. The reviewer describes the movie as "occasionally loud and offensive" and states that it "lulls you into a gentle waking coma", which suggests a lack of engagement or interest. This indicates a somewhat negative opinion, but not extremely so, as the tone is more matter-of-fact than scathing. \n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: she allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the given movie review is positive, as it mentions a desirable aspect of the movie, which is the honest confrontation of problems by the characters. \n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: that \'s because relatively nothing happens .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the given movie review is negative, as it mentions that "relatively nothing happens," which implies a lack of engagement or interest in the movie. \n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Assess the sentiment of the given movie review, categorizing it into one of five emotional categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - and present your classification in the specified format: <final_answer>answer</final_answer>, where answer represents the determined sentiment.\n\nInput: significantly better than its 2002 children 's - movie competition .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: it squanders chan 's uniqueness ; it could even be said to squander jennifer love hewitt !\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: ... the story , like ravel 's bolero , builds to a crescendo that encompasses many more paths than we started with .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg 's the prince of egypt from 1998 .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Evaluate the sentiment of a movie review by assessing the emotions conveyed in the text, then categorize it into one of five sentiment labels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and encapsulate your chosen sentiment category within the <final_answer>answer</final_answer> markers to clearly indicate the review\'s emotional tone.\n\nInput: reyes \' directorial debut has good things to offer , but ultimately it \'s undone by a sloppy script\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, we need to assess the emotions conveyed in the text. The review states that the director\'s debut "has good things to offer," which suggests a positive aspect of the movie. However, it also mentions that it is "ultimately undone by a sloppy script," which is a negative criticism.\n\nThe presence of both positive and negative comments indicates a mixed sentiment. The positive comment acknowledges some redeeming qualities, but the negative comment about the script being "sloppy" seems to outweigh the positive, as it is described as the factor that "ultimately" undoes the good aspects. This suggests that the negative aspect has a more significant impact on the overall opinion of the movie.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiment of the review is not very negative, as it does recognize some good qualities, nor is it positive or very positive, since the criticism seems to have a more significant impact. It\'s also not entirely neutral, as the reviewer does express a leaning towards a negative opinion due to the script issue.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment of the review is best categorized as negative, as it acknowledges some positive aspects but is ultimately critical due to a significant flaw.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: be forewarned , if you \'re depressed about anything before watching this film , you may just end up trying to drown yourself in a lake afterwards .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of this movie review is extremely unfavorable, as it implies that the film has a profoundly negative impact on the viewer\'s mental state, potentially exacerbating feelings of depression to a severe degree. The mention of a drastic and tragic action, such as drowning oneself, underscores the reviewer\'s strong negative emotions towards the movie\'s effect.\n\n<final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> very positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, "an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work," we need to assess the emotions conveyed in the text. The key phrases here are "effortlessly accomplished" and "richly resonant," both of which carry very positive connotations. The term "effortlessly accomplished" suggests a high level of skill and mastery, implying that the movie is of very high quality and was made with ease, which is a rare and admirable trait. The phrase "richly resonant" indicates that the work has a deep emotional impact and complexity, contributing to its excellence.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentiment of the review is very positive, as it uses language that indicates a high level of admiration and appreciation for the movie\'s quality and impact.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a blair witch - style adventure that plays like a bad soap opera , with passable performances from everyone in the cast .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down the key components and the emotions they convey:\n\n1. **"a blair witch - style adventure"**: This part of the sentence is neutral, as it simply describes the style of the movie without expressing a positive or negative opinion.\n\n2. **"that plays like a bad soap opera"**: The comparison to a "bad soap opera" is negative. The word "bad" explicitly conveys a negative sentiment, suggesting that the reviewer did not think highly of the movie\'s quality or execution in this aspect.\n\n3. **"with passable performances from everyone in the cast"**: The term "passable" is somewhat neutral to slightly positive, implying that while the performances were not outstanding, they were at least acceptable or satisfactory.\n\nGiven these observations, the overall sentiment of the review leans towards being negative. The negative comment about the movie playing like a "bad soap opera" has a stronger impact on the overall sentiment than the mildly positive comment about the performances being "passable." However, the criticism is not severe enough to categorize the review as "very negative," as there is some acknowledgment of acceptable performances.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: you \'ll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter ... \'\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break down the key elements and emotions conveyed in the text: "you\'ll feel like you ate a Reese\'s without the peanut butter."\n\n1. **Reference to a Familiar Experience**: The review uses a relatable analogy involving Reese\'s, a well-known candy that typically consists of peanut butter covered in chocolate. The combination of peanut butter and chocolate is a key part of its appeal.\n\n2. **Absence of a Key Component**: By saying "without the peanut butter," the reviewer is highlighting the absence of a crucial element that makes the experience (in this case, eating a Reese\'s) enjoyable or complete.\n\n3. **Implication of Incompleteness or Lack**: The analogy suggests that the movie leaves the viewer with a sense of something missing, similar to how a Reese\'s without peanut butter would be incomplete and less satisfying.\n\nGiven these points, the sentiment conveyed is negative because the reviewer implies that the movie lacks a crucial element that would make it enjoyable or satisfying, much like a Reese\'s candy without its peanut butter filling.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Classify the emotional tone of the given film review into one of five categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and encapsulate your chosen sentiment between the <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags, adhering to the format: <final_answer>answer</final_answer>.\n\nInput: the pianist is the film roman polanski may have been born to make .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: creeps you out in high style , even if nakata did it better .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: k-19 : the widowmaker is a great yarn .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the entire movie is so formulaic and forgettable that it 's hardly over before it begins to fade from memory .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:"]

😶Generated Prompts: ["Evaluate the emotional tone of a movie review and assign it to one of five sentiment categories, ranging from very negative to very positive, by determining the overall sentiment as very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and present the classification in the specified format: <final_answer> selected_sentiment </final_answer> to clearly indicate the sentiment of the film review.\n\nInput: smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: even though it is infused with the sensibility of a video director , it does n't make for completely empty entertainment\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Evaluate the sentiment of a movie review by assessing the emotions conveyed in the text, then categorize it into one of five sentiment labels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and format your response with the chosen category enclosed within <final_answer>answer</final_answer> tags, where the answer reflects the review\'s emotional tone.\n\nInput: smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, we need to assess the emotions conveyed in the text. The review states that the movie is "smart and fun," which suggests a positive tone. However, it also mentions that the movie is "far more witty than it is wise," which could imply a slight criticism or a mixed opinion.\n\nGiven these points, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards being positive, as the reviewer acknowledges the movie\'s smartness and fun aspects. The criticism about the movie being more witty than wise does not seem to overshadow the positive comments entirely. Therefore, the sentiment is positive but not extremely so, as there is a balance between praise and a mild criticism.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: the kind of film that leaves you scratching your head in amazement over the fact that so many talented people could participate in such an ill-advised and poorly executed idea .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: none of the characters or plot-lines are fleshed-out enough to build any interest .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the movie review is negative because it states that none of the characters or plot-lines are developed enough to generate interest, which implies a lack of engagement or enjoyment. This criticism suggests that the reviewer did not find the movie compelling, leading to a negative assessment. Therefore, the review\'s emotional tone is negative.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: efteriades gives the neighborhood -- scenery , vibe and all -- the cinematic equivalent of a big , tender hug .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: feel free to go get popcorn whenever he \'s not onscreen .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg \'s the prince of egypt from 1998 .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: lurid and less than lucid work .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the sentiment of the given movie review, we look at the words used: "lurid" and "less than lucid." "Lurid" typically has a negative connotation, suggesting something is sensational, shocking, or garish in an unpleasant way. "Less than lucid" implies a lack of clarity or coherence, which is also negative. Given these observations, the review expresses a negative sentiment towards the movie.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the sentiment of a movie review, categorizing it into one of five emotional tones: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and then clearly label the classification by enclosing it within <final_answer> tags, such as <final_answer> the chosen sentiment </final_answer>, to provide a transparent and marked indication of the review\'s emotional category.\n\nInput: it \'s a visual rorschach test and i must have failed .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: will anyone who is n\'t a fangoria subscriber be excited that it has n\'t gone straight to video ?\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review seems to imply a sense of skepticism or sarcasm regarding the movie\'s release and its potential appeal to a wider audience beyond fans of the magazine Fangoria. The tone suggests that the movie might not be of high quality or interest to the general public, which is why it questions the excitement about it not going straight to video. This kind of questioning typically indicates a negative sentiment, as it implies doubt about the movie\'s value or appeal.\n\nGiven the context, the sentiment of this review can be categorized as negative because it expresses doubt and skepticism rather than outright hatred or extreme dissatisfaction, which would be characteristic of a very negative review. It does not, however, express any positive sentiments or even neutrality, as the tone is clearly critical.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are ... an amusing little catch .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review describes the movie as "more sophisticated and literate than such pictures usually are" and an "amusing little catch." This suggests that the reviewer holds the movie in high regard, appreciating its intellectual depth and entertainment value. The tone is upbeat and commendatory, indicating a favorable opinion of the film. Given the positive adjectives used, the sentiment can be classified as positive, but since it doesn\'t use superlatives like "excellent" or "outstanding," it doesn\'t reach the level of "very positive." Therefore, the sentiment of the review is <final_answer> positive </final_answer>.\n\nInput: one of the most exciting action films to come out of china in recent years .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review describes the movie as "one of the most exciting action films to come out of China in recent years," which indicates a strong enthusiasm and praise for the film. This kind of language suggests that the reviewer holds the movie in high regard, highlighting its excitement and implying it stands out among other action films from China. Given this positive language, the sentiment of the review is very positive.\n\n<final_answer> very positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: the film is a fierce dance of destruction .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: for a film about explosions and death and spies , `` ballistic : ecks vs. sever \'\' seems as safe as a children \'s film .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review describes the movie as "very moving and revelatory," which indicates a strong emotional impact and high praise. This suggests that the reviewer holds the movie in high regard, appreciating its ability to evoke emotions and provide new insights into the Holocaust. Given this, the sentiment of the review is clearly on the positive end of the spectrum, leaning towards the highest level of praise due to the use of "very" to modify "moving," which intensifies the positive sentiment.\n\n<final_answer> very positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s a shame the marvelous first 101 minutes have to be combined with the misconceived final 5 .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review expresses a mixed sentiment, acknowledging the excellence of the majority of the movie ("the marvelous first 101 minutes") but criticizing the ending ("the misconceived final 5"). However, the criticism is focused on a relatively small part of the movie, and the positive description of the first part is strong. Therefore, the overall sentiment leans towards being negative, as the reviewer seems to be disappointed by the conclusion of the film, which tarnishes their otherwise positive experience.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the sentiment expressed in the given movie review and categorize it into one of five emotional tone categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - ensuring your chosen category is enclosed within <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags after careful consideration of the review\'s content.\n\nInput: final verdict : you \'ve seen it all before .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: anyone who welcomes a dash of the avant-garde fused with their humor should take pleasure in this crazed , joyous romp of a film .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review describes the film as a "crazed, joyous romp," which suggests a strong enthusiasm and appreciation for the movie\'s unconventional approach to humor. The use of the word "joyous" specifically implies a high level of delight and amusement. Therefore, the sentiment expressed in the review is extremely favorable.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: bread , my sweet has so many flaws it would be easy for critics to shred it .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: the film is so packed with subplots involving the various silbersteins that it feels more like the pilot episode of a tv series than a feature film .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment expressed in the review is negative because it compares the film unfavorably to a TV series pilot, implying that the movie feels disjointed or incomplete due to its numerous subplots. This suggests that the reviewer found the film\'s structure or pacing to be lacking. Therefore, the emotional tone category of the review is negative.\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput:']

The emotional tone conveyed in the given movie review is generally positive, as it describes the movie as "smarter and subtler" than other films. However, it also mentions that the plot may be "too convoluted" for some audiences, which introduces a slightly negative note.

The review mentions that the directorial debut "has good things to offer," which suggests a positive aspect of the movie.\n2. However, it also states that it is "ultimately undone by a sloppy script," which is a significant negative criticism.\n\nGiven these points, the review acknowledges some positive elements but is overall critical due to a major flaw (the script). This indicates that the sentiment is not very negative, as it does recognize some good aspects, but it is also not positive or very positive because the criticism about the script seems to outweigh the positives. The review does not seem entirely neutral either, as it clearly states both positive and negative opinions, leaning more towards criticism.\n\nTherefore, the sentiment of the review is negative, as it highlights a significant flaw that outweighs the acknowledged positive aspects.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: earnest but heavy-handed .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: a searing , epic treatment of a nationwide blight that seems to be , horrifyingly , ever on the rise .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: instead of building to a laugh riot we are left with a handful of disparate funny moments of no real consequence .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: an honest , sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: good performances keep it from being a total rehash .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Assess the sentiment of the given movie review by evaluating its emotional content and categorize it into one of five distinct sentiment labels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and present your classification in the specified format: <final_answer>answer</final_answer>, where answer represents the sentiment category that best describes the tone of the review.\n\nInput: vividly conveys the passion , creativity , and fearlessness of one of mexico 's most colorful and controversial artists -- a captivating drama that will speak to the nonconformist in us all .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> very positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: cox offers plenty of glimpses at existing photos , but there are no movies of nijinsky , so instead the director treats us to an aimless hodgepodge .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: significantly better than its 2002 children 's - movie competition .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: what 's infuriating about full frontal is that it 's too close to real life to make sense .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: the innate theatrics that provide its thrills and extreme emotions lose their luster when flattened onscreen .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: not since ghostbusters has a film used manhattan 's architecture in such a gloriously goofy way .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'To classify the emotional tone of a movie review, analyze its content and assign it to one of five categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - based on the sentiment expressed, and encapsulate your classification within <final_answer> tags for clear identification, such as <final_answer>answer</final_answer>, ensuring the sentiment categorization is unmistakable and readily accessible.\n\nInput: unfolds as one of the most politically audacious films of recent decades from any country , but especially from france .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the sentiment of a movie review and assign it to one of five emotional categories, ranging from very negative to very positive, and encapsulate your classification between the <final_answer>answer</final_answer> tags, ensuring the response adheres to the required format by inserting the sentiment label - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - in place of "answer" to accurately reflect the review\'s emotional tone.\n\nInput: if mr. zhang \'s subject matter is , to some degree at least , quintessentially american , his approach to storytelling might be called iranian .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: an honest , sensitive story from a vietnamese point of view .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: romanek \'s themes are every bit as distinctive as his visuals .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Ensure your response is formatted as <final_answer> the chosen sentiment category </final_answer>, where the chosen sentiment category is one of the five specified classifications, to effectively convey the emotional tone of the movie review.\n\nInput:', 'For a given cinematic critique, determine the emotional tone it conveys, categorizing it as either very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and present your classification in the specified format, enclosing your chosen category within <final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: sometimes charming , sometimes infuriating , this argentinean ` dramedy \' succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the emotional tone of the given cinematic critique, let\'s analyze the key words and phrases: "sometimes charming," "sometimes infuriating," and "succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors."\n\n- "Sometimes charming" suggests a positive aspect, indicating that the film has endearing moments.\n- "Sometimes infuriating" suggests a negative aspect, indicating that the film also has frustrating or annoying moments.\n- "Succeeds mainly on the shoulders of its actors" implies that the film\'s success is largely due to the performances of the actors, which is a positive commentary on the acting but may also subtly suggest that other elements of the film are not as strong.\n\nGiven these observations, the critique seems to balance between positive and negative comments. However, it does acknowledge the film\'s success, albeit conditionally, and praises the actors. The tone is not overwhelmingly negative or positive but rather mixed. Since it mentions both positive ("charming") and negative ("infuriating") aspects without a clear leaning towards very negative or very positive, and considering it does find a significant redeeming quality in the actors\' performances, the tone can be considered as generally positive but with significant reservations.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nBased on the given cinematic critique, "an effortlessly accomplished and richly resonant work," the emotional tone conveyed is one of high praise and admiration. The use of the words "effortlessly accomplished" and "richly resonant" suggests a deep appreciation for the work\'s quality and impact. Therefore, the classification of this critique is very positive.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: spider-man is in the same category as x-men - occasionally brilliant but mostly average , showing signs of potential for the sequels , but not giving us much this time around .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: the plot is romantic comedy boilerplate from start to finish .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe , but the movie is certainly not number 1 .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the emotional tone of the given cinematic critique, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **"paul bettany is good at being the ultra-violent gangster wannabe"** - This part of the statement is positive. It praises the actor\'s performance, indicating a skill or talent in portraying a specific character type.\n\n2. **"but the movie is certainly not number 1"** - This part introduces a contrast by using "but," which typically precedes a negative statement or a less favorable opinion compared to what was previously stated. The phrase "certainly not number 1" clearly indicates that the speaker does not consider the movie to be the best or among the best, which is a negative opinion.\n\nGiven these observations, the critique starts with a positive note about the actor\'s performance but then shifts to a negative opinion about the movie\'s overall quality or ranking. The negative comment about the movie\'s ranking seems to outweigh the positive comment about the actor, as it directly addresses the movie as a whole, which is typically the main focus of a cinematic critique.\n\nTherefore, the emotional tone conveyed by this critique is negative, as it expresses dissatisfaction with the movie\'s quality or standing, despite acknowledging a positive aspect (the actor\n\nInput: a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the emotional tone of the given cinematic critique, let\'s analyze the key phrases:\n\n1. "a completely spooky piece of business" - This phrase suggests that the film effectively evokes a spooky atmosphere, which can be seen as a positive aspect for a film aiming to be spooky.\n2. "gets under your skin" - This phrase implies that the film is impactful and memorable, affecting the viewer on a deeper level, which is generally a positive trait.\n3. "some plot blips aside" - This phrase indicates that there are some minor issues with the plot, but the use of "aside" suggests that these issues do not significantly detract from the overall experience.\n4. "stays there for the duration" - This phrase reinforces the idea that the film\'s impact is lasting, maintaining its effect throughout.\n\nConsidering these points, the critique seems to praise the film\'s ability to create a lasting, impactful experience, despite minor plot issues. Therefore, the emotional tone conveyed is positive, as it highlights the film\'s strengths in creating a memorable and spooky atmosphere.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Assess the sentiment of a given movie review, categorizing it into one of five emotional tone categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - based on the language and opinions expressed in the critique, and clearly denote the determined sentiment category within the designated markers <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for easy identification of the movie review's overall sentiment.\n\nInput: final verdict : you 've seen it all before .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: smart and fun , but far more witty than it is wise .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput:", "Assess the sentiment expressed in the provided movie review and categorize it into one of five emotional categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - and encapsulate your assessment in the format: <final_answer> chosen_sentiment </final_answer>, thereby determining the review's overall emotional tone.\n\nInput: it is an indelible epic american story about two families , one black and one white , facing change in both their inner and outer lives .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: for a film about explosions and death and spies , `` ballistic : ecks vs. sever '' seems as safe as a children 's film .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: cheap , vulgar dialogue and a plot that crawls along at a snail 's pace .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: lurid and less than lucid work .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: horrid little propaganda film with fascinating connections not only to the serbs themselves but also to a network of american right-wing extremists .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:"]

Once the sentiment analysis is complete, insert the corresponding sentiment label within <final_answer> tags, such as <final_answer>very_positive</final_answer>, to denote the review\'s emotional classification, ensuring the chosen sentiment is enclosed between the <final_answer> and </final_answer> markers for clear identification.\n\nInput: represents something very close to the nadir of the thriller\\/horror genre .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: and second , what \'s with all the shooting ?\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo assess the sentiment of the provided movie review, I need a review to analyze. However, based on your second question, "and second, what\'s with all the shooting?" it seems like you\'re expressing a concern or criticism about a movie or a scene involving a lot of shooting. This question implies a negative sentiment because it questions the necessity or appropriateness of the shooting in the context, suggesting discomfort or disagreement with the content.\n\nGiven this interpretation, the sentiment of your statement leans towards being negative because it expresses a concern or criticism. However, without a full review, it\'s challenging to determine the degree of negativity. Since your question implies a critique but does not express extreme dissatisfaction or anger, I would categorize the sentiment as negative rather than very negative.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: unspools like a highbrow , low-key , 102-minute infomercial , blending entrepreneurial zeal with the testimony of satisfied customers .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s full of cheesy dialogue , but great trashy fun that finally returns de palma to his pulpy thrillers of the early \'80s .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe review provided expresses a generally positive opinion of the movie, despite mentioning a negative aspect ("cheesy dialogue"). The reviewer describes it as "great trashy fun," which suggests they enjoyed the movie, and also appreciates its return to the director\'s earlier style. The positive comments outweigh the criticism, indicating a positive sentiment. However, the use of "trashy" might suggest that the reviewer doesn\'t consider it a high-brow or sophisticated film, which prevents the sentiment from being classified as "very positive." Therefore, the sentiment of this review is positive.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: when your subject is illusion versus reality , should n\'t the reality seem at least passably real ?\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentiment of the provided movie review expresses a negative opinion. The reviewer is criticizing the movie\'s portrayal of reality, implying that it fails to convincingly depict the real world. This suggests a negative tone, but it\'s not extremely harsh or angry, so it wouldn\'t be classified as very negative. \n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: far away .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe provided text "far away" does not contain a movie review. It seems to be a phrase that lacks context and does not express a clear opinion about a movie. However, based on the instruction to analyze the sentiment, I will categorize it as neutral since it does not convey any emotion or opinion.\n\n<final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: an uplifting , near-masterpiece .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Assess the emotional undertone of a given film review and assign it to one of five distinct sentiment categories - very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive - to gauge its overall sentiment, then encapsulate your evaluation within the designated format: <final_answer> the selected sentiment classification </final_answer>, ensuring the chosen classification aligns with one of the five predefined emotional categories, thereby accurately capturing the essence of the movie review's sentiment.\n\nInput: occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> very positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: an exceptionally dreary and overwrought bit of work , every bit as imperious as katzenberg 's the prince of egypt from 1998 .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: you wo n't have any trouble getting kids to eat up these veggies .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> positive </final_answer>\n\nInput: as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: for its 100 minutes running time , you 'll wait in vain for a movie to happen .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> very negative </final_answer>\n\nInput: the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> negative </final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'For a given cinematic critique, assess the prevailing emotional tone, selecting from a spectrum of sentiments that range from very negative to very positive, with neutral, negative, and positive sentiments in between, and encapsulate your assessment within the specified format: <final_answer> selected_sentiment </final_answer>, to categorize the review accurately.\n\nInput: if the film fails to fulfill its own ambitious goals , it nonetheless sustains interest during the long build-up of expository material .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:']
