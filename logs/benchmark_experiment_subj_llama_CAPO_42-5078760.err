😶Generated Prompts: ['Classify the sentiment of the provided sentence, distinguishing between objective statements that provide verifiable evidence and subjective expressions that convey personal opinions or emotions, and enclose your determination, either \'objective\' for fact-based sentences or \'subjective\' for opinion-driven sentences, within <final_answer> tags for a clear response.\n\nInput: day in , day out , the same routine is repeated .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "day in, day out, the same routine is repeated" can be classified as a statement that observes a pattern or a fact without expressing a clear personal opinion or emotion about the routine being good, bad, or otherwise. It simply states a repetition of activities, which can be verified if one observes the routine in question. Therefore, it leans towards being an objective statement as it reports on a state of affairs without overt emotional tone or personal judgment.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: peralta \'s mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Label the given sentence as either subjective or objective by discerning whether it presents a personal viewpoint, emotion, or opinion, or if it conveys factual, evidence-based information, and then enclose your classification, which should be either \'objective\' for factual sentences or \'subjective\' for sentences expressing personal perspectives, within <final_answer> tags, ensuring the response is limited to the classification itself, either \'objective\' or \'subjective\', between the tags.\n\nInput: suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n\'t . it \'s just incredibly dull .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided contains a personal opinion about a film, "waiting for happiness," stating that it is "incredibly dull." This evaluation is based on the speaker\'s subjective experience and emotional response to the film, rather than on verifiable facts or objective criteria. Therefore, the sentiment expressed is subjective, as it reflects the speaker\'s personal perspective or opinion about the film\'s quality.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: peralta \'s mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: lieutenant hart must then defend the black pilot against charges before an obviously racist american tribunal ; unaware that the trial itself is only a front for the real secret of the prison camp .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the tone and content of the provided sentence to distinguish between objective, fact-based information presented in a neutral tone, and subjective expressions that convey personal opinions, emotions, or biases. Categorize the sentence as either objective, if it provides verifiable information without emotional undertones, or subjective, if it includes personal judgments or feelings. Your assessment should result in one of two classifications: \'objective\' for sentences lacking personal perspective, or \'subjective\' for those that embody opinionated or emotional language. Format your response with the classification, either \'objective\' or \'subjective\', enclosed within <final_answer> </final_answer> tags, as in <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, to denote the sentence\'s nature clearly.\n\nInput: when they goes to the fence to get them , they discover that someone stole them .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the tone and content of the provided sentence, "when they goes to the fence to get them , they discover that someone stole them," let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Tone**: The tone seems neutral as it reports an event without expressing a clear emotion or personal opinion about the event itself. However, the use of "stole" implies a negative action, which could slightly tint the tone, but it\'s more of a factual report than an emotional expression.\n\n2. **Content**: The sentence describes an action and its consequence. It states that someone stole "them" (referring to unspecified objects), which is a verifiable action. The sentence does not express a personal judgment about the event or the people involved beyond the fact that stealing occurred, which is generally considered negative.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence primarily provides information about an event without expressing a personal opinion or emotion directly. The negative connotation of "stole" is inherent to the action itself rather than an injected opinion.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters \' striving solipsism .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives !\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what \'s possible and what we might do to make it so .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "To categorize a sentence, analyze its content to distinguish between a personal perspective, which would be labeled as 'subjective', and factual information, which is considered 'objective'. The distinction hinges on the presence of personal opinions, emotional undertones, or biased judgments in the sentence, versus the presentation of verifiable data without emotional influence. Your classification should be presented in the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, clearly indicating whether the sentence is subjective or objective based on its content and tone.\n\nInput: entwined with maggie 's search for hope , the film explores her interaction with her family and friends .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: bernal 's transformation from naive priest to tortured adulterer to hard-nosed careerist is riveting .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:"]

Ensure your response adheres to the specified format: <final_answer>subjective or objective</final_answer>, clearly indicating the sentence\'s nature based on the distinction between subjective and objective language.\n\nInput: but sometimes what we teach our children can be as deadly as not teaching them .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: but cousin roberto is n\'t the tough guy they \'d expected .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: when she fails to find the `` perfect man `` that will make her happy , she decides to construct him herself , using parts from different people .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence is subjective or objective, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence describes a character\'s actions and decisions in a narrative manner. The use of the phrase "the \'perfect man\'" could imply a subjective interpretation of what perfection entails, as perfection is often subjective and varies from person to person.\n\n2. **Evaluative Language**: The term "perfect" is evaluative, as it implies a judgment about what constitutes an ideal partner. This kind of language introduces a subjective element because the concept of perfection is not universally defined.\n\n3. **Neutral vs. Emotional Tone**: The sentence does not convey a strongly emotional tone but rather presents a scenario in a somewhat matter-of-fact way. However, the concept of constructing a "perfect man" from parts of different people introduces a fantastical or satirical element that might be interpreted as having a slightly humorous or critical undertone, depending on the context.\n\n4. **Personal Viewpoint**: The sentence seems to present a character\'s decision-making process without explicitly endorsing or criticizing her actions. However, the narrative choice to highlight her decision to "construct him herself" might reflect a personal viewpoint on themes such as relationships, happiness, or the search for an ideal\n\nInput: it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal viewpoint and emotional tone through the use of words like "offend," "put off," and "outrageousness," which convey a sense of strong opinion and evaluation. The phrase "but it holds you" also suggests a personal experience or reaction, indicating that the statement is not purely factual but rather an interpretation or opinion of the subject in question. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective due to its use of evaluative language and expression of personal viewpoint.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Sentence categorization challenge: determine whether a given sentence presents information in a neutral, factual manner or expresses a personal viewpoint.

The use of the phrase "if you love the music" and "and i do" indicates a personal preference, and the statement "its hard to imagine having more fun" is a subjective judgment about the enjoyment of watching a documentary. \n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **"in its understanding"** - This phrase suggests a perspective or interpretation, which could imply subjectivity.\n2. **"often funny way"** - The use of "funny" introduces a subjective judgment about the manner in which something is told. Humor is highly subjective and varies greatly from person to person.\n3. **"it tells a story"** - This part of the sentence is more neutral and could be either subjective or objective depending on the context of the story.\n4. **"whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation"** - This part of the sentence suggests an objective validation based on observable changes in the nation\'s composition. It implies that there are verifiable facts supporting the story\'s restatement.\n\nGiven these points, while the sentence does contain elements that could be considered objective (like the validation by the changing composition of the nation), the overall tone and some of the descriptors ("often funny way") introduce a level of subjectivity. The sentence reflects a personal judgment or interpretation, especially in how it characterizes the way the story is told.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` the best disney movie since the lion king ``\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Classify the sentiment of a given sentence as either subjective, which encompasses personal viewpoints, feelings, or appraisals, or objective, which presents verifiable information without bias.

To categorize a sentence, analyze its content to distinguish between a personal perspective, which would be labeled as 'subjective', and factual information, which is considered 'objective'. The distinction hinges on the presence of personal opinions, emotional undertones, or biased judgments in the sentence, versus the presentation of verifiable data without emotional influence. Your classification should be presented in the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, clearly indicating whether the sentence is subjective or objective based on its content and tone.

To tackle this challenge, you'll need to evaluate the tone and content of a given sentence, discerning whether it conveys information in a detached, factual way - which would earn it an 'objective' label - or if it incorporates personal biases, sentiments, or viewpoints, thereby qualifying as 'subjective'.

When you've made your determination, format your response as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present neutral, verifiable information or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that embody personal perspectives or feelings.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To categorize a sentence, analyze its content to distinguish between a personal perspective, which would be labeled as 'subjective', and factual information, which is considered 'objective'. The distinction hinges on the presence of personal opinions, emotional undertones, or biased judgments in the sentence, versus the presentation of verifiable data without emotional influence. Your classification should be presented in the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, clearly indicating whether the sentence is subjective or objective based on its content and tone.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Develop a classification system to categorize sentences into two distinct groups: subjective and objective. This entails scrutinizing the sentence\'s meaning to separate personal viewpoints from factual, verifiable details. The key to this differentiation lies in identifying the presence of emotional language, personal biases, or value judgments, which are hallmarks of subjective sentences, as opposed to objective sentences that convey information in a neutral, fact-based manner. To accomplish this, carefully examine the linguistic features and tone of the given sentence, and then render a judgment in the specified format, <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, to denote whether the sentence expresses a personal opinion or presents information in an unbiased, factual way.\n\nInput: rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: if a horror movie \'s primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well . . . a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: adapted from a monologue in his `` blue jam `` radio series , chris morris \' first short film is a haunting black comedy about a man who no longer uses his name because he \'s decided he \'s ceased to deserve one , and a dog called rothko who says he is the man \'s lawyer .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components and tone:\n\n1. **Source and Context**: The sentence mentions a specific work ("blue jam" radio series) and a creator (Chris Morris), which provides context but does not inherently bias the sentence towards being subjective or objective.\n2. **Descriptive Language**: The use of "haunting black comedy" introduces a subjective interpretation of the film\'s genre and impact. The term "haunting" can evoke a sense of eeriness or profound effect, which is a subjective experience.\n3. **Character and Plot Description**: The description of the man and the dog named Rothko who claims to be the man\'s lawyer is factual within the context of the story but does not carry emotional or value judgment beyond the narrative\'s setup.\n4. **Tone and Emotional Language**: The overall tone seems to be informative, aiming to describe the premise of the film. However, the choice of words like "haunting" introduces a layer of subjective interpretation.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence contains elements of both subjective interpretation (through the use of "haunting") and objective description (in outlining the plot and characters). However, the presence of emotional language ("haunting black comedy") tips the balance towards the sentence\n\nInput: ronnie schwann , a young man regarded as `` slow , `` has affections for sarah , a young woman who stays at hope house , a facility for the mentally ill .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components and tone:\n\n1. **Linguistic Features and Tone**: The sentence describes Ronnie Schwann as a "young man regarded as \'slow\'," which could imply a subjective judgment about his intellectual abilities or speed of understanding. However, the term "regarded as" suggests that this is a perception or opinion held by others, rather than an objective fact. The description of Sarah and her residence at "Hope House, a facility for the mentally ill" provides more factual information about her living situation without expressing a personal opinion about her character or the quality of the facility.\n\n2. **Emotional Language and Personal Biases**: The use of the term "slow" to describe Ronnie could be seen as having a slightly negative connotation, implying a personal bias or judgment. However, in the context of the sentence, it seems more to be setting the scene or providing background information rather than expressing the author\'s opinion. The overall tone of the sentence is more informative than evaluative.\n\n3. **Value Judgments**: The sentence does not explicitly contain value judgments about Ronnie\'s feelings for Sarah or the nature of their relationship. It simply states that Ronnie has affections for Sarah, which is a factual report of his\n\nInput:', 'Analyze the given sentence to discern its tone and intent, distinguishing between objective statements that convey factual information devoid of personal influence and subjective expressions that embody personal viewpoints, emotions, or evaluative judgments.

[ but ] the script goes wrong at several key junctures .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal viewpoint about an individual\'s ability to charm when given the right lines, indicating a subjective evaluation of their performance. Additionally, it criticizes the script, stating that it "goes wrong," which further suggests a personal judgment rather than an objective assessment. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective due to the presence of personal opinions and evaluative judgments.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: steve \'s best friend , sean , on the other hand , has n\'t been so lucky .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: soon , annie \'s condition helps leoncio \'s children realize the essence of a family .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, "soon, Annie\'s condition helps Leoncio\'s children realize the essence of a family," we need to break it down into its components and assess whether it conveys factual information or personal viewpoints.\n\n1. **Subject Matter**: The sentence discusses a situation involving characters (Annie and Leoncio\'s children) and a realization they come to regarding the essence of a family. This context suggests a narrative or thematic exploration rather than a factual report.\n\n2. **Language and Tone**: The use of the word "essence" implies a deeper, more abstract understanding of family, which is a subjective concept. The realization of such an essence is a personal or emotional understanding rather than a factual discovery.\n\n3. **Intent**: The intent here seems to be to convey a thematic or emotional message about family, rather than to inform about a verifiable fact. The sentence appears to be part of a narrative designed to evoke emotions or thoughts about the importance of family, which is a subjective interpretation.\n\n4. **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity**: Objective statements are typically verifiable and lack personal bias. In contrast, this sentence involves a personal or emotional realization, which cannot be universally verified and is influenced by the context of the story or the perspectives\n\nInput: god responds to his challenge and allows bruce to take on his powers to prove himself .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, "God responds to his challenge and allows Bruce to take on his powers to prove himself," we must consider its components and the context it implies.\n\n1. **Subject Matter**: The sentence involves a deity ("God") and a character named Bruce, suggesting a narrative or fictional context. The interaction between God and Bruce, particularly the act of God responding to a challenge and granting powers, is typical of mythological, religious, or comic book storylines.\n\n2. **Tone and Intent**: The tone appears to be narrative or descriptive, aiming to convey a sequence of events or actions within a story. The intent seems to be informative about the plot or character development, specifically focusing on Bruce\'s journey or test.\n\n3. **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity**: \n   - **Objective Statements** are factual, verifiable, and unbiased. They present information without personal influence.\n   - **Subjective Statements** include personal opinions, feelings, or biased perspectives. They are based on individual viewpoints and can vary from person to person.\n\nGiven these definitions, the sentence "God responds to his challenge and allows Bruce to take on his powers to prove himself" can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- The sentence describes a specific event or action involving\n\nInput: barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: just when it seems martha \'s influence may be having a favorable effect on greg \'s attitude , his old ways win out .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: nete forces a doctor to tell her how much time he has left .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Sentence classification task: Assess the given sentence to distinguish between objective statements that present verifiable facts without bias and subjective expressions that embody personal viewpoints, sentiments, or emotional undertones.

Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Classify sentences into two primary categories based on their tone and intent: sentences that provide information in a neutral, factual manner, which should be labeled as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, and sentences that express personal viewpoints, emotions, or evaluations, which should be marked as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. This distinction is crucial for understanding whether a sentence aims to inform with verifiable evidence or to persuade with personal opinions and feelings, thereby enabling the identification of the underlying sentiment and purpose behind each sentence.\n\nInput: in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThis classification is due to the presence of the phrase "often funny way", which introduces a personal evaluation of the manner in which the story is told, indicating that the sentence expresses a viewpoint or opinion rather than simply providing factual information.\n\nInput: lieutenant hart must then defend the black pilot against charges before an obviously racist american tribunal ; unaware that the trial itself is only a front for the real secret of the prison camp .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: police and investigators believed the murders were in retaliation for a robbery days prior to the murders .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "Barney has created a tour de force that is weird, wacky and wonderful" should be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. This classification is due to the use of evaluative adjectives such as "weird," "wacky," and "wonderful," which express a personal viewpoint or opinion about Barney\'s creation, rather than providing a neutral, factual description.\n\nInput: his family decides to go back on a holiday to india for 2 weeks , when tina discovers the truth about pooja \'s e-mails , they decide together that tina will play along with the charade .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes" should be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. This classification is due to the use of emotive language such as "aching beauty" and the expression of a personal emotional response ("brings tears to your eyes"), which indicates a personal viewpoint or evaluation rather than a neutral, factual report.\n\nInput: now he thinks he is seeing things that are n\'t there and if things do n\'t improve , she will take their only son and leave .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Develop a classification system to categorize sentences as either objective or subjective by determining whether they convey factual, unbiased information or express personal viewpoints, sentiments, or judgments, and label them accordingly as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for fact-based content and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for content that reflects the writer\'s emotions, opinions, or evaluations, effectively differentiating between informative and persuasive or emotive sentences.\n\nInput: `` the best disney movie since the lion king ``\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "the best disney movie since the lion king" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. This classification is due to the presence of the word "best," which expresses a personal viewpoint or opinion. The comparison to "the lion king" also implies a judgment based on personal taste or evaluation, rather than providing factual, unbiased information.\n\nInput: are the experiences of the main character profound , or simply routine ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: suffering from his flashbacks , vince does n\'t realize that ellen has also disappeared from the cemetery , right before his eyes .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: there \'s only one thing his cousin did n\'t tell him . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: part of the draw of dance is the impossibility to define its particular joy . tavernier \'s film conveys a large element of its appeal -- and more .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "part of the draw of dance is the impossibility to define its particular joy" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal viewpoint about the appeal of dance, using phrases like "part of the draw" and "particular joy" that convey a sense of emotional or personal connection.\n\nThe sentence "tavernier\'s film conveys a large element of its appeal -- and more" can also be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal evaluation or opinion about the film, using phrases like "conveys a large element of its appeal" that imply a value judgment or interpretation. The phrase "and more" also suggests a level of enthusiasm or endorsement that is characteristic of subjective language.\n\nInput: when they goes to the fence to get them , they discover that someone stole them .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "when they goes to the fence to get them , they discover that someone stole them" can be classified as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>. \n\nThis classification is based on the fact that the sentence reports an event (the theft of items) without expressing a personal viewpoint, sentiment, or judgment about the event. The sentence sticks to conveying what happened without inserting any emotional tone or bias, making it a factual, objective statement.\n\nInput:', "Determine the tone of the provided sentence, deciding whether it conveys information in an impartial, factual way or if it incorporates personal feelings, opinions, or assessments.

To determine the tone of a given sentence, you must discern whether it conveys factual, unbiased information or if it embodies personal perspectives, sentiments, or appraisals. Your goal is to classify sentences into two distinct categories: those that present information in a detached, evidence-based manner and those that convey a personal stance, feeling, or assessment. In your response, use <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to denote sentences that are grounded in fact and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for sentences that reflect opinion, emotion, or personal judgment, thereby clarifying the sentence's underlying intent and emotional resonance.

Input: you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they 're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sentence "you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they 're each interesting" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal opinion about the stories being interesting. 

The sentence "the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll" can also be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it contains personal judgments about the movie being "well shot", "tragic", and worth pondering, which are all subjective evaluations.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

Ensure your response is formatted with the classification, either \'subjective\' or \'objective\', enclosed within <final_answer> tags, like this: <final_answer>your classification</final_answer>, to clearly indicate whether the sentence is a factual statement or an expression of personal opinion or feeling.\n\nInput: it \'s not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n\'t . it \'s just incredibly dull .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "it\'s not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn\'t. it\'s just incredibly dull." expresses a personal viewpoint regarding the quality and entertainment value of a film. The use of the word "dull" to describe the film indicates a subjective judgment about the film\'s ability to engage or interest the viewer. This kind of evaluation is based on personal taste and experience, rather than on objective, verifiable criteria. Therefore, the sentence should be classified as subjective because it reflects the speaker\'s personal opinion or sentiment about the film.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` the best disney movie since the lion king ``\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "the best Disney movie since the Lion King" expresses a comparison and an evaluation of quality, which is inherently subjective because "best" is a matter of personal opinion. The Lion King is used as a benchmark, implying that the speaker holds it in high regard, but the judgment of what constitutes "the best" can vary greatly from person to person. Therefore, this statement reflects a personal viewpoint or sentiment rather than a fact that can be verified with objective evidence.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: amanda is faced with making right decisions amidst trying circumstances .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence "Amanda is faced with making right decisions amidst trying circumstances" is subjective or objective, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Subject**: The sentence is about Amanda, a specific individual, which could imply a personal or subjective perspective. However, the subject itself does not necessarily make the statement subjective.\n2. **Action**: Amanda is "faced with making right decisions," which implies a challenge or a situation she is in. The phrase "making right decisions" suggests an evaluation or judgment about the nature of the decisions, which could introduce a subjective element since what constitutes a "right" decision can vary based on personal beliefs or values.\n3. **Context**: The phrase "amidst trying circumstances" adds a descriptive layer to Amanda\'s situation, indicating that the conditions are difficult. This description of the circumstances as "trying" could be seen as an interpretation or subjective evaluation of the situation, as the perception of difficulty can vary from person to person.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence does express a viewpoint on Amanda\'s situation and the nature of her decisions and circumstances, which involves an interpretation or evaluation. Therefore, it should be classified as subjective because it implies a judgment about what is "right" and describes the circumstances with\n\nInput: as the day unfolds , the decisions become clearer and yet more difficult to make as the characters question what the true meaning of their lives are .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, we must consider whether it presents a personal viewpoint, sentiment, or emotional tone, or if it provides information based on verifiable evidence without personal bias.\n\nThe sentence discusses characters questioning the true meaning of their lives, which suggests an exploration of themes or plot elements often found in literature, film, or other narrative forms. The phrase "as the day unfolds" and the description of decisions becoming "clearer and yet more difficult to make" imply a narrative progression or character development. The sentence does not express a direct opinion about these elements but rather describes a situation or plot point.\n\nHowever, the interpretation of characters\' questioning of the "true meaning of their lives" could be seen as having a slightly subjective tone because it implies a depth of introspection and existential questioning that might be perceived differently by various readers or viewers. Yet, the sentence itself does not express a personal viewpoint on this introspection but rather states it as a part of the narrative.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence leans more towards being a description of a narrative or thematic element rather than an expression of personal opinion or emotion. It presents a scenario without overt judgment or emotional tone, aiming to inform or describe rather than persuade or express a sentiment.\n\n<final_answer>objective\n\nInput: tong is sent back to fetch some things for devlin and unknowingly tries on devlin \'s tuxedo and finds that it gives extraordinary powers to anyone that dons the suit .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Accurately categorizing sentences into subjective or objective classifications requires a nuanced understanding of the language used, distinguishing between statements that present verifiable facts and those that convey personal opinions or emotional inclinations. This process entails a detailed examination of the sentence\'s language to ascertain whether it embodies a neutral, fact-driven tone or if it is colored by individual perspectives, biases, or sentimental undertones. The goal is to assess the sentence\'s content and tone to determine its classification as either objective, where information is presented in an unbiased and verifiable manner, or subjective, where the expression is influenced by personal sentiments, judgments, or prejudices. Your objective is to meticulously evaluate the sentence and subsequently classify it as either <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, denoting a neutral and fact-based presentation, or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, indicating a presentation that is influenced by personal views, emotions, or biases, based on the distinction between factual, unbiased information and the expression of personal opinions or biases.\n\nInput: steve \'s best friend , sean , on the other hand , has n\'t been so lucky .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: offers 102 minutes of breezy , occasionally very funny entertainment .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "offers 102 minutes of breezy, occasionally very funny entertainment" is classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThe reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence includes the words "breezy" and "funny," which are subjective terms that can vary in interpretation from person to person. What one individual finds funny or breezy, another might not. This indicates that the sentence is expressing a personal opinion or sentiment rather than presenting verifiable, factual information.\n\nInput: this event leads to deep thoughts about marriage , friendship , relationships and last not least life itself .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after baptizing their amnesiac boy-toy chris , the infamous pair takes him on a grand tour of their wild nightlife frolic , their spontaneous media extravaganza and their dazzling diva lifestyle in order to help him find his identity and his way home .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThe phrase "is no picnic" is an idiomatic expression that implies difficulty or hardship, which introduces a subjective interpretation of life on the reservation. The use of this phrase suggests a negative perspective or opinion about life on the reservation, rather than presenting a neutral or fact-based description. Additionally, the phrase "this picture shows you why" implies that the image is being used to support or illustrate a personal viewpoint or opinion, further indicating a subjective tone. Overall, the sentence conveys a personal sentiment or judgment about life on the reservation, rather than presenting verifiable facts in a neutral manner.\n\nInput: this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful" is classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThe reasoning behind this classification is as follows:\n- The use of the word "fascinating" introduces a personal opinion or emotional inclination, as what one person finds fascinating, another might not.\n- The comparison of the look at Israel to "the latest news footage from Gaza" and the description of dramas as "heightened" and "well-shaped" suggests a value judgment that is subjective.\n- The phrase "twice as powerful" is also a subjective evaluation, as the measurement of power in this context is not quantifiable or universally agreed upon, but rather dependent on individual interpretation.\n- Overall, the sentence\'s tone and language convey a personal perspective or opinion, rather than presenting verifiable facts in a neutral manner.\n\nInput: after a drastic confrontation with the \'normal \' outside world that results in fighting and panic , the group breaks up .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "after a drastic confrontation with the \'normal \' outside world that results in fighting and panic , the group breaks up" can be classified as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>.\n\nReasoning: \nThe sentence describes a sequence of events and their consequences without expressing a personal opinion or emotional inclination. It reports on actions (confrontation, fighting, panic, the group breaking up) in a neutral tone, focusing on what happened rather than how the events should be perceived or judged. The use of words like "drastic" might suggest a degree of intensity but does not necessarily introduce a subjective bias into the description of the events. The overall presentation is fact-driven, aiming to inform about the occurrence and outcome of the confrontation without expressing a personal viewpoint or sentiment.\n\nInput: he dies alone at the hospital , and apparently everything nete planned went wrong .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Develop a classification system to categorize sentences into two distinct categories: subjective and objective. This entails a nuanced evaluation of the sentence's language, focusing on the presence or absence of emotional undertones, personal biases, and verifiable evidence. The primary goal is to discern whether a sentence presents information in a factual, unbiased manner or if it embodies personal opinions, sentiments, or prejudiced perspectives. To achieve this, scrutinize the sentence for indicators of subjectivity, such as emotional language, personal beliefs, or biased viewpoints, which contrast with the neutral, evidence-based presentation characteristic of objective sentences. Upon analyzing the sentence's tone and content, render a judgment on whether it aligns with the criteria for objective or subjective classification, and format your response as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> to signify the sentence's categorization.\n\nInput: this is scorsese 's finest work , and one of the best films of 2002 .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:"]

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

It mentions the creation of a website named "searching for Mr. Right . com" aimed at finding husbands for them. The language used is straightforward and descriptive, focusing on the action and the purpose of the website.\n\n2. **Factual Information vs. Personal Perspectives**: The sentence primarily conveys factual information about the creation of a website and its purpose. It does not express a personal opinion about the morality, effectiveness, or appropriateness of using a website to find husbands. The information is presented in a neutral manner without emotive language that could indicate a bias or personal conviction.\n\n3. **Emotive Language, Biases, or Personal Convictions**: The sentence lacks emotive language or phrases that could suggest biases or personal convictions. The tone remains neutral, focusing on the event (creation of the website) and its purpose.\n\n4. **Neutral, Fact-Based Presentation**: The presentation is neutral and fact-based, as it simply reports on the creation of a website and its intended use without evaluating the decision or the method.\n\nBased on\n\nInput: it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: blueberry is stationed in the little town of palomito as sheriff .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone of the given sentence, "blueberry is stationed in the little town of palomito as sheriff," let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Language and Sentiment**: The sentence is simple and straightforward, stating a fact about "blueberry" being stationed in a specific location as a sheriff. There\'s no overt emotive language, biases, or personal convictions expressed in the sentence.\n\n2. **Factual Information vs. Personal Perspectives**: The information provided is about a character or entity named "blueberry" and their role in a town named "palomito." Without additional context, this can be seen as a statement of fact within a narrative or descriptive context. There\'s no clear personal perspective or opinion being expressed.\n\n3. **Neutral, Fact-Based Presentation**: The presentation is neutral, as it simply states a condition or situation without evaluating it as good, bad, desirable, or undesirable. There\'s no emotional appeal or attempt to persuade the reader towards a particular viewpoint.\n\n4. **Objective vs. Subjective Tone**: Given the lack of emotive language, biases, or personal judgments, the sentence leans towards being objective.

The sentence includes words and phrases such as "so dumb," "so exploitative," and "clumsy," which are emotive and convey a negative opinion about the subject in question. The use of the word "ironically" also suggests a personal perspective on the situation, as it implies a judgment about the intended and actual effects of the re-do. Furthermore, the sentence expresses a clear opinion that the re-do "becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against," which indicates a subjective interpretation of the original\'s message and the re-do\'s impact.\n\nGiven the presence of emotive language, personal opinions, and biased judgments, the tone of the sentence is not neutral or fact-based. Instead, it embodies personal views and emotional responses, which are hallmarks of subjective sentences.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: now he thinks he is seeing things that are n\'t there and if things do n\'t improve , she will take their only son and leave .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone of the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Language and Sentiment**: The sentence includes phrases like "thinks he is seeing things that aren\'t there," which implies a judgment about someone\'s perception of reality. This could be seen as a factual observation but also carries a hint of skepticism or concern, which is somewhat subjective. The phrase "if things don\'t improve" suggests a condition based on an evaluation of the situation, which can be seen as a personal perspective. The threat of "she will take their only son and leave" introduces a consequence that is emotionally charged and based on personal decisions or actions, indicating a subjective stance.\n\n2. **Emotive Language**: Words and phrases like "thinks he is seeing things that aren\'t there" and "she will take their only son and leave" evoke emotions. The first part might evoke concern or skepticism, while the second part clearly evokes a sense of potential loss or desperation, which are emotional responses.\n\n3. **Biases or Personal Convictions**: The sentence implies a judgment about someone\'s mental state ("seeing things that aren\'t there") and a potential action based on personal dissatisfaction or fear ("she will take their only son and leave"). These are\n\nInput: missing her opportunity with him that night , cameron diaz is talked into pursuing him to his brother \'s wedding .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the tone of the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Language and Sentiment**: The sentence describes a scenario involving Cameron Diaz being persuaded to attend a wedding, which implies a narrative or story element. The use of "missing her opportunity" introduces a sense of potential loss or regret, which can be seen as emotive. However, the overall structure of the sentence is more descriptive of an event or situation rather than expressing a clear opinion or emotion directly.\n\n2. **Factual Information vs. Personal Perspectives**: The sentence does not provide factual information in the traditional sense (e.g., historical data, scientific facts) but rather sets up a scenario that could be part of a story, possibly from a movie or a personal anecdote. The inclusion of a specific name, "Cameron Diaz," suggests it might be referring to a known event or plotline from a film.\n\n3. **Emotive Language, Biases, or Personal Convictions**: The phrase "missing her opportunity" has an emotive connotation, suggesting a potential for regret or longing.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective).

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Discerning Sentiment in Text: Your objective is to develop a keen sense of the tone and intent behind each sentence, differentiating between those that convey factual information in a detached, unbiased manner and those that betray the presence of personal feelings, opinions, or prejudices. To accomplish this, scrutinize the language and tone employed in each sentence, recognizing that subjective expressions often weave in personal biases, emotional appeals, or speculative opinions, whereas objective statements are grounded in empirical evidence and presented in a neutral, unprejudiced way. The classification process involves determining whether a sentence is free from personal influence and presents information in a verifiable, neutral light, in which case it should be categorized as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, or if it embodies personal perspectives, sentiments, or emotional undertones that diverge from factual evidence, warranting its classification as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. Your challenge is to meticulously categorize each sentence into one of these two categories, denoting your classification with the corresponding label to signify whether the sentence presents a neutral, fact-based account or a personalized, emotionally tinged viewpoint.\n\nInput: the movie has generic virtues , and despite a lot of involved talent , seems done by the numbers .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: scott calvin ( tim allen ) has been santa claus for the past eight years , and his loyal elves consider him the best santa ever .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence: "Scott Calvin (Tim Allen) has been Santa Claus for the past eight years, and his loyal elves consider him the best Santa ever."\n\nThis sentence can be classified as **subjective**.\n\nReasoning: The phrase "consider him the best Santa ever" introduces a personal opinion or sentiment, as it reflects the elves\' subjective evaluation of Scott Calvin\'s performance as Santa. The use of the superlative "best" also implies a value judgment, which is a characteristic of subjective language. While the first part of the sentence ("Scott Calvin has been Santa Claus for the past eight years") presents factual information, the second part ("his loyal elves consider him the best Santa ever") injects a personal perspective, making the overall sentence subjective.\n\nInput: set in hollywood , `` coming clean `` is a 12 character ensemble romantic comedy about an engagement party gone wrong .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI would categorize the sentence as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>. \n\nThe sentence provides factual information about a movie, including its setting and plot, without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. The tone is neutral and informative, suggesting a detached and unbiased presentation of the information.\n\nInput: just on the other side of thirty , dave is an unemployed sculptor clumsily going nowhere in a small town .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: dennis clegg is in his thirties and lives in a halfway house for the mentally ill in london .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI would categorize the sentence as **objective**. The sentence provides factual information about Dennis Clegg\'s age and living situation without expressing any personal opinion, emotion, or bias. The language used is neutral and verifiable, presenting a straightforward account of his circumstances.\n\nInput: his odyssey finally leads him onto a theatre stage .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: . . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence ". . . comes alive only when it switches gears to the sentimental" should be categorized as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. This classification is due to the presence of the word "sentimental," which implies an emotional or personal perspective, suggesting that the statement is influenced by personal feelings or opinions rather than being a neutral, fact-based observation.\n\nInput:', 'Classify sentences into two categories based on their tone: those that provide unbiased, factual information and those that express personal views, emotions, or evaluations. To accomplish this, analyze each sentence to distinguish between fact-based, impartial content and language that conveys a personal perspective, sentiment, or opinion. Your classification should result in one of two labels: <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information in a neutral, evidence-based manner, and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for sentences that embody personal opinions, feelings, or judgments, allowing you to discern the intent and emotional undertone of each sentence.\n\nInput:', 'Classify sentences into two categories based on their tone: those that provide impartial, fact-based information, labeled as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, and those that express personal opinions, emotions, or biases, labeled as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, by analyzing the language and intent behind each sentence to determine whether it presents a neutral, evidence-driven perspective or a personalized viewpoint that may be influenced by feelings or individual judgments.\n\nInput: are the experiences of the main character profound , or simply routine ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a charming trifle . . . a welcome return to jocular form .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "a charming trifle . . . a welcome return to jocular form" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal opinion about the quality and appeal of something, using words like "charming" that convey a positive emotional tone and imply a personal judgment rather than a neutral, fact-based assessment.\n\nInput: you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they \'re each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they \'re each interesting" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal opinion about the stories being interesting. \n\nThe sentence "the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll" can also be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it contains personal judgments about the movie being "well shot", "tragic", and worth pondering, which are all subjective evaluations.\n\nInput: however , soon they have the cops and the anti-terror corps on their tails .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "however, soon they have the cops and the anti-terror corps on their tails" can be classified as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, as it appears to provide a factual description of a situation without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. The language used is neutral and simply states a sequence of events, without any emotional tone or bias.\n\nInput: the question is , will their lives change forever with the riches that come along with professional sports , or will they be destined to live a life in their home country , asking forever , what if ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: luster is a refreshingly funny and sexy look at unrequited love .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Determine whether a given sentence presents information in a neutral, fact-based manner or if it conveys a personal perspective by evaluating its language and tone. The distinction between objective and subjective sentences hinges on the presence of emotive language, personal opinions, or biased perspectives, which are characteristic of subjective sentences, as opposed to the impartial presentation of evidence-based data that defines objective sentences. Categorize sentences as either objective, which encompasses statements supported by empirical evidence and verifiable facts, or subjective, which includes expressions of personal feelings, emotional tone, or evaluative judgments. Evaluate the sentence to ascertain whether it presents information in a neutral, evidence-based manner or if it expresses personal opinions, sentiments, or biased evaluations, and respond with a single word - either "objective" or "subjective" - enclosed within <final_answer> </final_answer> tags, indicating the presence of objective, verifiable information or subjective opinion in the sentence, using only the text \'subjective\' or \'objective\' to denote the classification.\n\nInput:']

Sentence Classification Task: Distinguish between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that express personal perspectives or emotions. The key to this task lies in identifying the tone and language used, recognizing that subjective sentences often incorporate biased language, personal opinions, or emotional appeals, whereas objective sentences rely on verifiable evidence and neutral presentation.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone.

The key to differentiating between subjective and objective sentences lies in identifying the presence of emotional undertones, personal beliefs, or biased language, which are characteristic of subjective sentences, as opposed to the impartial presentation of evidence, which defines objective sentences. By leveraging your understanding of the distinction between subjective and objective language, evaluate the given sentence to determine whether it presents information in a neutral, verifiable manner, categorizing it as objective, or if it expresses personal sentiments, feelings, or biased judgments, categorizing it as subjective. The classification process entails a thorough examination of the sentence\'s tone and content to determine whether it should be labeled as objective, indicating a neutral, fact-based tone, or subjective, indicating a tone influenced by personal opinions, emotions, or biases. Your task is to carefully assess the sentence and then classify it as either <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to denote a neutral, evidence-based tone, or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> to signify a personal, emotional, or biased tone, clearly indicating its nature and content\n\nInput: amelia is a jaded top model , nina is a midwestern innocent on her first trip , fernanda is a bisexual supermodel , ellie is the calm , sensible stylist .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: armed with a game supporting cast , from the pitch-perfect forster to the always hilarious meara and levy , like mike shoots and scores , doing its namesake proud .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "too stagey, talky -- and long -- for its own good" is <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>.

The phrase "for its own good" also suggests a personal evaluation rather than a neutral, fact-based assessment.

The use of words like "grand battle" might suggest a slight dramatic tone, but overall, the sentence focuses on conveying information about the event rather than expressing a personal viewpoint.\n\nInput: the tuxedo was n\'t just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , \'hungry-man portions of bad \' .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "the tuxedo was n\'t just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , \'hungry-man portions of bad \' " is <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThis categorization is due to the presence of a personal opinion and emotional tone. The use of the phrase "hungry-man portions of bad" is a colloquial and humorous way of expressing a strong negative opinion, which indicates a subjective evaluation rather than a neutral, fact-based description. Additionally, the reference to a personal friend, David Cross, and the use of his quote further emphasizes the personal and subjective nature of the statement.\n\nInput:', 'Distinguish between sentences that convey factual, unbiased information, rooted in tangible evidence and data, marked as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, and those that embody personal perspectives, emotions, or opinions, which are labeled as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, by carefully examining the tone, language, and purpose of each sentence to ascertain whether it offers an impartial, fact-based account or a personalized interpretation that may be swayed by emotional undertones or individual predispositions, and provide a classification, either "objective" or "subjective", enclosed within <final_answer> </final_answer> tags, to signify whether the sentence presents verifiable, neutral information or an opinionated viewpoint.\n\nInput: first kammy meets the 40-year-old danny ( dave wong ) and falls head over heels .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: suffering from his flashbacks , vince does n\'t realize that ellen has also disappeared from the cemetery , right before his eyes .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Analyze the given sentence to discern its tone and intent, distinguishing between objective statements that convey factual information devoid of personal influence and subjective expressions that embody personal viewpoints, emotions, or evaluative judgments. Categorize the sentence as objective if it presents information that can be verified and is free from bias, or as subjective if it includes personal opinions, feelings, or biased perspectives, and format your classification as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for factual sentences or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for opinion-based sentences.\n\nInput: the girl \'s lover thinks she \'s been kidnapped , and goes looking for her .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, "the girl\'s lover thinks she\'s been kidnapped, and goes looking for her," we need to break down its components and assess the tone and intent.\n\n1. **Objective Elements**: The sentence reports on an action (the lover going to look for the girl) and a situation (the girl\'s disappearance). These actions and situations can be considered as events that could potentially be verified. However, the interpretation of these events (e.g., the belief that she has been kidnapped) introduces a layer of subjectivity.\n\n2. **Subjective Elements**: The key phrase "thinks she\'s been kidnapped" indicates a belief or opinion held by the girl\'s lover. This belief is not presented as a fact but as a personal interpretation of the situation. The use of "thinks" suggests that the statement is from the perspective of the lover, introducing a subjective viewpoint.\n\n3. **Intent**: The intent of the sentence seems to be to convey a narrative or a storyline rather than to present factual information. It sets up a scenario that could be part of a larger story, focusing on the emotions and actions of the characters involved.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence includes both objective (actions, events) and subjective (beliefs,\n\nInput: nete forces a doctor to tell her how much time he has left .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: steve \'s best friend , sean , on the other hand , has n\'t been so lucky .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this is scorsese \'s finest work , and one of the best films of 2002 .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: scott calvin ( tim allen ) has been santa claus for the past eight years , and his loyal elves consider him the best santa ever .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Sentence Classification Task: Distinguish between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that express personal perspectives or emotions. The key to this task lies in identifying the tone and language used, recognizing that subjective sentences often incorporate biased language, personal opinions, or emotional appeals, whereas objective sentences rely on verifiable evidence and neutral presentation. Your goal is to evaluate each sentence and categorize it as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal views or emotional tone, or objective, signifying a neutral, evidence-based presentation of information. Clearly mark your classification as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to indicate whether the sentence conveys personal opinions and feelings or factual, unbiased information.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

It simply states what happens to "they" (the subjects) in a neutral, factual manner, without any language that conveys a personal perspective, sentiment, or opinion. The use of "however" indicates a contrast to a previous statement but does not introduce a subjective tone.

"the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll ." - This sentence is also <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it contains evaluative language ("well shot", "very tragic") that reflects the speaker\'s opinion and emotional response to the movie.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

Use the classification format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to denote the tone and intent of each sentence, thereby highlighting its underlying emotional tone and purpose.\n\nInput: the only element of suspense is whether the movie will change titles or distributors again before the closing credits roll .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: when she fails to find the `` perfect man `` that will make her happy , she decides to construct him herself , using parts from different people .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'To accomplish this classification task, you must assess the tone and content of a given sentence, determining whether it presents information from a neutral, factual standpoint or if it embodies personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones.

Your goal is to evaluate each sentence and categorize it as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal views or emotional tone, or objective, signifying a neutral, evidence-based presentation of information. Clearly mark your classification as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to indicate whether the sentence conveys personal opinions and feelings or factual, unbiased information.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

This classification is due to the use of the words "smart" and "sassy," which convey a personal opinion or emotional tone regarding the interpretation of the Oscar Wilde play, rather than presenting a neutral, fact-based description.\n\nInput: with nothing to go on but his dreams and gut instinct , vince launches into his own search for ellen . . . or is he really searching for sara ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what \'s possible and what we might do to make it so .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is: "by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world, pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what\'s possible and what we might do to make it so."\n\nThis sentence is classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. The reasoning behind this classification is as follows:\n\n1. **Interpretation of the Text**: The sentence involves an interpretation of the text "pumpkin," which likely refers to a story, book, or film. The interpretation that it "dares us to say why either is impossible" introduces a subjective analysis of the author\'s intent and the reader\'s response.\n\n2. **Emotional and Reflective Tone**: The sentence encourages reflection on what is "possible" and invites the reader to consider actions to make something "so." This reflective and somewhat inspirational tone suggests a personal or emotional engagement with the subject matter, rather than a purely factual or neutral presentation.\n\n3. **Lack of Concrete Evidence**: The sentence does not provide concrete, verifiable evidence to support its claims about the text\'s impact or the reader\'s potential responses. Instead, it offers a personal perspective on how the narrative might influence readers\' thoughts and feelings.\n\n4. **Use of\n\nInput: rugged contractor rick eyes beth but ends up going home with the more assertive debby .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is: "an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy."\n\nThis sentence is classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. The language used, such as "incredibly irritating," "thoroughly vacuous," and "worst excesses," reflects personal opinions and emotional undertones, indicating a biased viewpoint rather than a neutral, fact-based presentation. The use of strong adjectives to describe the comedy and its characters suggests that the statement is influenced by the writer\'s personal feelings or tastes, making it subjective.\n\nInput:', "Accurately categorize sentences into two distinct categories: subjective or objective.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

Sentence Classification Task: Distinguish between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that express personal perspectives or emotions. The key to this task lies in identifying the tone and language used, recognizing that subjective sentences often incorporate biased language, personal opinions, or emotional appeals, whereas objective sentences rely on verifiable evidence and neutral presentation. Your goal is to evaluate each sentence and categorize it as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal views or emotional tone, or objective, signifying a neutral, evidence-based presentation of information. Clearly mark your classification as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to indicate whether the sentence conveys personal opinions and feelings or factual, unbiased information.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

Sentence Classification Task: Distinguish between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that express personal perspectives or emotions.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To accomplish this, analyze each sentence to determine if it presents verifiable evidence or if it conveys a personal perspective. Use <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that are fact-based and unbiased, and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for sentences that reflect personal feelings, opinions, or biases, allowing you to distinguish between sentences that inform and those that persuade or express emotion.\n\nInput: however , soon they have the cops and the anti-terror corps on their tails .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they \'re each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they \'re each interesting" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal opinion about the stories being interesting. \n\nThe sentence "the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll" can also be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it contains personal judgments about the movie being "well shot", "tragic", and worth pondering, which are all subjective evaluations.\n\nInput:', "To accurately categorize sentences, it's crucial to differentiate between language that is factual and unbiased, and language that is influenced by personal feelings or opinions. This distinction is key to determining whether a sentence is objective, presenting information in a neutral and factual way, or subjective, conveying a personal perspective or emotional tone. The task requires analyzing the tone and content of each sentence to decide whether it belongs to the objective category, characterized by its neutral and evidence-based presentation, or the subjective category, marked by the presence of personal biases, opinions, or emotional appeals. Your objective is to carefully examine each sentence and label it as either <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if it presents information in a neutral and fact-based manner, or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if it expresses personal views, emotions, or biases, thereby ensuring that your classification reflects the sentence's tone and content accurately.\n\nInput: it is bad , but certainly not without merit as entertainment .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", "Develop a sentiment classification model to differentiate between sentences that convey factual information in a neutral tone and those that embody personal sentiments or emotional undertones. This endeavor requires a nuanced examination of the linguistic elements and tone employed in each sentence, as subjective expressions often betray biased language, personal convictions, or emotional appeals, whereas objective expressions are characterized by their reliance on empirical evidence and impartial presentation. Your objective is to scrutinize each sentence and assign it to one of two categories: subjective, denoting the presence of personal biases, emotional resonance, or opinionated language, or objective, indicating a neutral, fact-based, and verifiable presentation of information. Classify each sentence as either objective, implying a factual and unbiased account, or subjective, suggesting an opinion-driven, emotionally charged, or personally influenced narrative, and clearly denote your classification as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to distinguish between sentences that convey personal opinions and those that present factual, unbiased information.\n\nInput: nete forces a doctor to tell her how much time he has left .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: now he thinks he is seeing things that are n't there and if things do n't improve , she will take their only son and leave .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'To distinguish between sentences that convey information in a neutral and factual manner versus those that reflect personal opinions or emotions, examine the language and tone used in each sentence.

Categorize sentences as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> when they present information in an unbiased and factual way, or as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> when they embody opinions, feelings, or biases, indicating a personal viewpoint or emotional undertone, and thus determining the underlying purpose and emotional impact of the sentence.\n\nInput: jamie has a `` to-do `` list for her life and also a very big secret she must keep from landon .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: too stagey , talky -- and long -- for its own good .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "too stagey, talky -- and long -- for its own good" is <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThis categorization is due to the presence of evaluative words such as "too stagey" and "too talky," which reflect personal opinions regarding the appropriate level of these qualities. The phrase "for its own good" also implies a judgment about what would be beneficial or desirable, further indicating a subjective viewpoint.

The phrase "has to be seen to be believed" also suggests a level of astonishment or incredulity, further emphasizing the subjective nature of the sentence. Overall, the language and tone used convey a personal viewpoint and emotional undertone, categorizing the sentence as subjective.\n\nInput: missing her opportunity with him that night , cameron diaz is talked into pursuing him to his brother \'s wedding .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

😶Generated Prompts: ["Determine the tone of each sentence, categorizing it as either subjective or objective based on whether it provides an impartial, evidence-based account or expresses a personal viewpoint, sentiment, or prejudice. To make this distinction, examine each sentence closely to identify if it offers a neutral, fact-driven narrative or if it embodies a personal stance, opinion, or emotional undertone. Utilize the label <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that convey information in a factual and unbiased manner, and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that encapsulate personal beliefs, opinions, or emotional responses, thereby differentiating between informative and persuasive or emotionally charged sentences. Carefully evaluate each sentence and assign it to either the 'subjective' category, which encompasses opinions, appraisals, or emotional expressions, or the 'objective' category, which presents verifiable data without personal inclination, and format your response as: <final_answer>your classification</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'For the given sentence, determine whether it expresses a personal viewpoint, emotion, or opinion, categorizing it as \'subjective\', or if it presents information based on facts and evidence, classifying it as \'objective\'. Your assessment should be encapsulated within <final_answer> tags, following this format: <final_answer>subjective or objective</final_answer>, to clearly indicate the sentence\'s nature.\n\nInput: the question is , will their lives change forever with the riches that come along with professional sports , or will they be destined to live a life in their home country , asking forever , what if ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after an attempt is made on his life by unknown gunmen , whom he kills them all using martal arts skills he did n\'t know he had , he learns that all of his dreams of a past life are real and that for the past three years he was raised by the couple after finding him in a river , half-dead with five bullet wounds in him .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: syd does accept him and befriends him and shows him how to live .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the stars may be college kids , but the subject matter is as adult as you can get : the temptations of the flesh are unleashed by a slightly crazed , overtly determined young woman and a one-night swim turns into an ocean of trouble .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence expresses a viewpoint that is influenced by personal taste and preference, as it uses words like "love" and "appreciate" which are subjective experiences. The description of humor as "whimsical" also adds a layer of personal interpretation. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it reflects personal opinions about how different age groups might react to certain elements of a story or entertainment.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: unlike conventional movies , kill bill is told in chapter format making the narrative flow more like a book than a film .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine the nature of the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Comparison to Conventional Movies**: The sentence starts by comparing "Kill Bill" to conventional movies, which is a factual comparison based on the structure of the movie versus others in the same medium.\n\n2. **Narrative Structure**: It mentions that "Kill Bill" is told in chapter format. This is an objective fact about the movie\'s narrative structure.\n\n3. **Comparison to a Book**: The sentence then compares the narrative flow of "Kill Bill" to that of a book, suggesting that the chapter format makes it feel more like reading a book than watching a conventional film. This comparison is based on the structural similarity between the movie and books, which is an observable fact.\n\n4. **Interpretation of Narrative Flow**: The statement that the narrative flows "more like a book than a film" could be seen as slightly subjective, as it implies an interpretation of how the chapter format affects the viewing experience. However, this interpretation is based on the objective fact of the chapter format and how it might influence the viewer\'s experience in a way that is generally comparable to reading.\n\nGiven these points, the sentence primarily presents information based on facts and evidence (the chapter format of\n\nInput:', 'Distinguish between sentences that are fact-based and those that convey personal perspectives by categorizing them as either objective, which refers to statements supported by tangible evidence and data, or subjective, which involves expressions of emotion, opinion, or personal assessment. To accomplish this, analyze each sentence to ascertain whether it presents information that can be verified (objective) or if it reflects an individual\'s feelings or viewpoints (subjective). Your classification should be denoted by a single word, either "objective" for sentences with verifiable content or "subjective" for sentences that express personal sentiments, and should be formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> to clearly indicate the nature of the sentence.\n\nInput:', 'Distinguish between sentences that convey information in a detached, evidence-based manner and those that embody a personal stance, sentiment, or prejudice. This entails scrutinizing each sentence to ascertain whether it presents information that can be verified or if it embodies a viewpoint that is colored by individual emotions or opinions. Categorize sentences as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if they offer unbiased, factual data in a neutral tone, and as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if they encapsulate personal sentiments, opinions, or biases, by examining the linguistic cues and the underlying intent of each sentence to discern whether it presents a balanced, fact-driven perspective or a personalized outlook that may be swayed by emotions or individual predispositions.\n\nInput: rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment" is <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThis categorization is due to the presence of a personal opinion or sentiment within the sentence. The phrase "so little entertainment" is an evaluation that depends on individual taste and experience, indicating a subjective judgment rather than an objective, verifiable fact. The use of "rarely" also suggests a comparison based on personal experience or opinion, further supporting the subjective nature of the statement.\n\nInput: a charming trifle . . . a welcome return to jocular form .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "a charming trifle . . . a welcome return to jocular form" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal opinion about the quality and appeal of something, using words like "charming" that convey a positive emotional tone and imply a personal judgment rather than a neutral, fact-based assessment.\n\nInput: ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year \'s best acting , personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year\'s best acting, personal velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum" can be categorized as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThis categorization is due to several reasons:\n1. The use of evaluative terms like "funny" and "shattering" which are subjective experiences and can vary greatly from person to person.\n2. The phrase "some of the year\'s best acting" is also subjective as it implies a personal opinion or judgment about the quality of the acting.\n3. The overall tone of the sentence seems to be praising or appreciating the dramatic momentum of "Personal Velocity", which suggests a positive sentiment or opinion.\n\nOverall, the sentence embodies a personal stance or sentiment rather than presenting unbiased, factual data in a neutral tone.\n\nInput: marco and melanie , a young married couple , are living a life of passion , with chaotic situations , and all the little frustrations of daily life .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

Sentence Classification Task: Distinguish between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that express personal perspectives or emotions. The key to this task lies in identifying the tone and language used, recognizing that subjective sentences often incorporate biased language, personal opinions, or emotional appeals, whereas objective sentences rely on verifiable evidence and neutral presentation. Your goal is to evaluate each sentence and categorize it as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal views or emotional tone, or objective, signifying a neutral, evidence-based presentation of information. Clearly mark your classification as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to indicate whether the sentence conveys personal opinions and feelings or factual, unbiased information.

Additionally, the use of the phrase "even as you have to admit" implies a sense of personal concession, which further supports the subjective nature of the sentence.

To accomplish this, carefully examine each sentence to determine whether it presents verifiable evidence and measurable data in an impartial way, or if it expresses opinions, sentiments, or judgments. Upon evaluation, label the sentence as either <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if it maintains a neutral, evidence-based tone, or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if it bears the marks of personal influence, emotional undertones, or biased language, ensuring your response adheres to the specified format by returning either 'objective' or 'subjective' within the <final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: with nothing to go on but his dreams and gut instinct , vince launches into his own search for ellen . . . or is he really searching for sara ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: he dies alone at the hospital , and apparently everything nete planned went wrong .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: douglas mcgrath 's nicholas nickleby does dickens as it should be done cinematically .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: soon , annie 's condition helps leoncio 's children realize the essence of a family .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Analyze the given sentence to discern its tone and intent, distinguishing between objective statements that convey factual information devoid of personal influence and subjective expressions that embody personal viewpoints, emotions, or evaluative judgments. Categorize the sentence as objective if it presents information that can be verified and is free from bias, or as subjective if it includes personal opinions, feelings, or biased perspectives, and format your classification as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for factual sentences or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for opinion-based sentences.\n\nInput: an incredibly irritating comedy about thoroughly vacuous people . . . manages to embody the worst excesses of nouvelle vague without any of its sense of fun or energy .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a strong negative opinion about a comedy, using phrases such as "incredibly irritating," "thoroughly vacuous people," and "worst excesses." These phrases convey a personal viewpoint and evaluative judgment, indicating a subjective tone. The sentence does not present verifiable, unbiased information but rather a personal opinion about the quality and characteristics of the comedy. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this is scorsese \'s finest work , and one of the best films of 2002 .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: first kammy meets the 40-year-old danny ( dave wong ) and falls head over heels .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: steve \'s best friend , sean , on the other hand , has n\'t been so lucky .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the girl \'s lover thinks she \'s been kidnapped , and goes looking for her .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: just when it seems martha \'s influence may be having a favorable effect on greg \'s attitude , his old ways win out .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: confuses its message with an ultimate desire to please , and contorting itself into an idea of expectation is the last thing any of these three actresses , nor their characters , deserve .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a negative opinion about something, likely a movie or performance, and how it affects the actresses and their characters. The use of words like "confuses" and "contorting" indicates a critical and disapproving tone, which suggests a personal viewpoint rather than a neutral, factual report. The sentence also includes the phrase "is the last thing any of these three actresses, nor their characters, deserve," which further emphasizes the subjective nature of the statement by implying a judgment of what the actresses and characters deserve, based on the speaker\'s opinion.\n\nTherefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it embodies personal opinions and evaluative judgments rather than presenting verifiable, unbiased information.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: soon , annie \'s condition helps leoncio \'s children realize the essence of a family .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, "soon, Annie\'s condition helps Leoncio\'s children realize the essence of a family," we must break down its components to understand its tone and intent.\n\n1. **Subject Matter**: The sentence discusses a situation involving Annie and her impact on Leoncio\'s children, focusing on their realization about the essence of a family. This subject matter is narrative and suggests a storyline or character development.\n\n2. **Tone**: The tone appears to be reflective or possibly sentimental, as it involves a realization about family, which is often an emotionally charged topic. The use of "essence of a family" suggests a depth of understanding or feeling that goes beyond mere factual information.\n\n3. **Intent**: The intent seems to be to convey a moment of understanding or enlightenment experienced by the characters (Leoncio\'s children) regarding the nature of family, facilitated by Annie\'s condition. This implies a narrative or thematic intent rather than a purely informational one.\n\n4. **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity**: \n   - **Objective statements** are those that can be verified and are free from personal bias. They typically deal with facts, data, or observable phenomena without emotional or personal judgment.\n   - **Subjective statements** express personal opinions, feelings\n\nInput:', 'Accurately categorizing sentences into subjective or objective classifications requires a nuanced understanding of the language used, distinguishing between statements that present verifiable facts and those that convey personal opinions or emotional inclinations. This process entails a detailed examination of the sentence\'s language to ascertain whether it embodies a neutral, fact-driven tone or if it is colored by individual perspectives, biases, or sentimental undertones. The goal is to assess the sentence\'s content and tone to determine its classification as either objective, where information is presented in an unbiased and verifiable manner, or subjective, where the expression is influenced by personal sentiments, judgments, or prejudices. Your objective is to meticulously evaluate the sentence and subsequently classify it as either <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, denoting a neutral and fact-based presentation, or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, indicating a presentation that is influenced by personal views, emotions, or biases, based on the distinction between factual, unbiased information and the expression of personal opinions or biases.\n\nInput: the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i \'m not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided is: "completely creatively stillborn and executed in a manner that i \'m not sure could be a single iota worse . . . a soulless hunk of exploitative garbage."\n\nThis sentence is classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. The language used is highly critical and emotive, with phrases like "creatively stillborn," "soulless hunk of exploitative garbage," which clearly convey a strong personal opinion or judgment about the subject in question. The tone is negative and biased, indicating a subjective evaluation rather than a neutral, fact-based presentation.\n\nInput: lieutenant hart must then defend the black pilot against charges before an obviously racist american tribunal ; unaware that the trial itself is only a front for the real secret of the prison camp .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: without [ de niro ] , city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back , single-handed .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "" is classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThis classification is due to the use of figurative language and hyperbole ("slip under the waves", "drags it back, single-handed") which convey a personal opinion or emotional inclination towards De Niro\'s impact on the city. The statement is not a verifiable fact, but rather an expression of admiration or praise for De Niro, indicating a subjective tone.\n\nInput: are the experiences of the main character profound , or simply routine ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: we see the action of the book as we see kaufman struggle to adapt it into a movie .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Develop a classification system to differentiate sentences based on their emotional undertones, separating those that convey factual data in an unbiased way from those that embody personal sentiments or emotional undertones. The essence of this endeavor lies in deciphering the linguistic cues and tone, acknowledging that sentences with subjective inclinations frequently include prejudiced terminology, personal viewpoints, or emotional entreaties, whereas their objective counterparts hinge on empirical evidence and an impartial presentation. Your objective is to scrutinize each sentence and assign it to one of two categories: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, denoting the presence of personal biases or emotional resonance, or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, indicating a neutral, fact-driven exposition.

Sentence Classification Task: Distinguish between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that express personal perspectives or emotions.

Your goal is to evaluate each sentence and categorize it as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal views or emotional tone, or objective, signifying a neutral, evidence-based presentation of information. Clearly mark your classification as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to indicate whether the sentence conveys personal opinions and feelings or factual, unbiased information.

Classify sentences into two distinct categories based on their tone: those that present information in a neutral and verifiable manner, and those that convey personal feelings or biases. Your goal is to determine whether a sentence is rooted in facts and evidence, making it <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, or if it reflects personal opinions and emotions, categorizing it as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. To accomplish this, carefully analyze each sentence and decide whether it can be classified as objective, meaning it is free from personal influence and based on provable facts, or subjective, indicating it expresses a personal viewpoint or sentiment. Respond with the classification of the sentence in the format <final_answer>classification</final_answer>, choosing 'objective' for sentences that are fact-based and 'subjective' for those that reflect personal perspectives, thus identifying the underlying sentiment and tone of the given sentence.

It does not present verifiable facts or unbiased data but rather an opinion on the work\'s portrayal of its characters and themes.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

😶Generated Prompts: ["When analyzing a sentence, the goal is to identify whether it conveys information in a neutral, fact-based manner or if it's infused with personal perspectives, emotions, or biases. To accomplish this, carefully examine the sentence and determine if it should be labeled as 'subjective'—indicating the presence of opinions, emotional undertones, or personal judgments—or 'objective,' signifying that the information is presented in an impartial and verifiable way. The key to this classification lies in assessing the sentence's tone and content to decide whether it fits into the 'objective' category, characterized by its neutral and evidence-based presentation, or the 'subjective' category, marked by the influence of personal feelings, views, or prejudices. Format your classification as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that are factually neutral and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that express personal sentiments or biases.\n\nInput: blueberry is stationed in the little town of palomito as sheriff .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: two badly interlocked stories drowned by all too clever complexity .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` the best disney movie since the lion king ``\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", "Develop a classification system to distinguish between sentences that provide impartial, fact-based information and those that convey personal beliefs, emotions, or opinions. The task involves sorting sentences into two distinct categories: one for sentences that present verifiable data in a neutral tone, labeled as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, and another for sentences that express individual viewpoints, sentiments, or evaluations, labeled as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. To achieve this, assess whether each sentence is grounded in evidence and free from bias, or if it reflects a personal stance, feeling, or judgment, and then classify it accordingly, using the format: <final_answer>classification</final_answer>, where 'objective' denotes sentences based on facts and 'subjective' denotes sentences influenced by personal perspectives.\n\nInput: just on the other side of thirty , dave is an unemployed sculptor clumsily going nowhere in a small town .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: suffering from his flashbacks , vince does n't realize that ellen has also disappeared from the cemetery , right before his eyes .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: jamie has a `` to-do `` list for her life and also a very big secret she must keep from landon .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: deacon , matt and fred will do anything for even a glimpse of sex and spend their mornings pirating porno movies from fred 's after school job at the video store .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: as fran 's requests become more peculiar , chep is thrown into increasingly bizarre situations .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Accurately identifying the sentiment of a sentence requires distinguishing between language that is neutral, fact-driven, and unbiased, and language that is colored by personal views, emotions, or predispositions. The objective is to sort sentences into two primary groups: those that deliver information in an unprejudiced, evidence-supported way and those that express a personal viewpoint, sentiment, or evaluation. To achieve this, you must assess the tone and substance of each sentence, labeling it as either <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if it presents information in a neutral, fact-based manner, or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if the language is swayed by opinions, feelings, or biases, thus illuminating the sentence\'s underlying tone and emotional impact. Your classification should be grounded in a meticulous examination of the sentence, taking into account whether it incorporates personal opinions, emotions, or assessments, or if it communicates factual, impartial information.\n\nInput: welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he \'s finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence you\'ve provided can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThe reasons for this classification include:\n1. The use of the phrase "Welles groupie/scholar" to describe Peter Bogdanovich, which introduces a personal viewpoint by implying a level of admiration or bias towards Orson Welles.\n2. The phrase "finally provided his own broadside" suggests a sense of anticipation or expectation, which is a subjective interpretation of the timing and significance of Peter Bogdanovich\'s actions.\n3. The description of William Randolph Hearst as a "publishing giant" could be seen as neutral, but in the context of the sentence, it contributes to an overall tone that is evaluative rather than purely factual.\n4. The tone of the sentence, which seems to approve of Peter Bogdanovich\'s action ("finally provided his own broadside"), indicates a personal viewpoint or sentiment.\n\nOverall, while the sentence conveys information, its language and tone are influenced by personal opinions or biases, making it subjective.\n\nInput: his father , aglanar , was happy at his birth that he would have a strong and honorable son to carry on the traditions of the valley .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of cho \'s fans .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "a movie that will surely be profane, politically charged music to the ears of Cho\'s fans" is <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThe language used in this sentence is colored by personal views and predispositions, as indicated by the descriptive phrases "will surely be profane" and "politically charged music to the ears of Cho\'s fans". The word "profane" carries a negative connotation, implying a value judgment, and the phrase "music to the ears" is a figurative expression that suggests a positive emotional response from Cho\'s fans, which is a subjective interpretation. Overall, the tone of the sentence is evaluative and opinionated, rather than neutral and fact-based.\n\nInput: life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why" would be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThe phrase "is no picnic" is an idiomatic expression that implies difficulty or hardship, which introduces a negative sentiment. Additionally, the use of "rez" (a colloquial or informal term for reservation) may carry a certain tone or connotation. The sentence as a whole expresses a personal viewpoint or evaluation of life on the reservation, rather than presenting a neutral, fact-based description. The inclusion of "this picture shows you why" further suggests that the sentence is leading the reader to a specific interpretation or emotional response, which is also characteristic of subjective language.\n\nInput: day in , day out , the same routine is repeated .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "day in, day out, the same routine is repeated" can be classified as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>. This classification is based on the fact that the sentence describes a situation in a neutral, fact-based manner without expressing a personal opinion, emotion, or bias. The use of the phrase "day in, day out" is an idiomatic expression that emphasizes the regularity of the routine, but it does not introduce a subjective tone. The sentence simply states a fact about the repetition of a routine without evaluating it as good, bad, or otherwise, which aligns with the characteristics of objective language.\n\nInput: after chance brings them together they create , \'searching for mr right . com , `` a web site to locate husbands for marie and liz .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "after chance brings them together they create , \'searching for mr right . com , `` a web site to locate husbands for marie and liz" can be classified as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>.\n\nReasoning: \nThe sentence primarily reports on an action taken by the individuals (creating a website) without expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the action itself. It states a fact about what they did (creating a website for a specific purpose) without evaluating the morality, effectiveness, or any other aspect of their decision. The tone is neutral and informative, aiming to convey what happened rather than how the event should be perceived.\n\nInput: but cousin roberto is n\'t the tough guy they \'d expected .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: he falls for hunky diner owner matt , who falls just as hard back .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Classify sentences into two main categories based on their tone: those that provide information in a neutral and factual way, and those that express a personal opinion or emotion. To accomplish this, analyze each sentence and determine whether it presents verifiable evidence or conveys a personal perspective. Use <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that are fact-based and unbiased, and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for sentences that reflect personal feelings, opinions, or biases, allowing you to distinguish between sentences that inform and those that persuade or express a particular viewpoint.\n\nInput: after chance brings them together they create , \'searching for mr right . com , `` a web site to locate husbands for marie and liz .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i have n\'t encountered since at least pete \'s dragon .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: first kammy meets the 40-year-old danny ( dave wong ) and falls head over heels .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: there \'s only one thing his cousin did n\'t tell him . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a brain twister , less a movie-movie than a funny and weird meditation on hollywood , success , artistic integrity and intellectual bankruptcy .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer> \n\nThis sentence is classified as subjective because it expresses a personal opinion about the movie, using words like "funny", "weird", and "meditation", which convey the author\'s emotional response and interpretation. The sentence also includes value judgments like "artistic integrity" and "intellectual bankruptcy", which are subjective evaluations rather than objective facts. Overall, the tone is persuasive and expressive, rather than neutral and factual.\n\nInput: are the experiences of the main character profound , or simply routine ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: tom green and an ivy league college should never appear together on a marquee , especially when the payoff is an unschooled comedy like stealing harvard , which fails to keep 80 minutes from seeming like 800 .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: jamie has a `` to-do `` list for her life and also a very big secret she must keep from landon .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

The classification process demands a careful reading of each sentence, with the ultimate goal of assigning it to one of two categories: <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that adhere to a neutral, fact-based tone, and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer\n\nInput: mark , fresh from college , returns to his boring hometown to work off his gambling debts .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i have n\'t encountered since at least pete \'s dragon .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: only the android attendants are still capable of action , mindlessly maintaining and administering the \'drip \' .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the only thing that matters for him is break dancing .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: mark , fresh from college , returns to his boring hometown to work off his gambling debts .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: without [ de niro ] , city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back , single-handed .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "without [ de niro ] , city by the sea would slip under the waves . he drags it back , single-handed" is <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThis classification is due to the use of figurative language and hyperbole ("slip under the waves", "single-handed"), which convey a personal opinion or emotional investment in the statement, rather than presenting a verifiable fact. The tone is also laudatory and suggestive of admiration for De Niro, further indicating a subjective perspective.\n\nInput: this is the kind of movie where the big scene is a man shot out of a cannon into a vat of ice cream .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nI would categorize the sentence as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. The sentence expresses a personal and whimsical description of a movie scene, using phrases like "the kind of movie" which implies a personal perspective or opinion. The tone is also informal and playful, suggesting that the sentence is expressing the author\'s subjective view or interpretation of the movie, rather than presenting a neutral or factual description.\n\nInput:', "Classify sentences into two categories based on their tone and intent: those that provide unbiased, fact-based information, which should be labeled as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, and those that convey personal opinions, emotions, or biased language, which should be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. To accomplish this, analyze the language and tone used in each sentence, recognizing that objective sentences present information in a neutral, evidence-based manner, while subjective sentences embody personal perspectives, sentiments, or appraisals, and categorize them accordingly.\n\nInput: no ill effects are immediately apparent to lena 's relatives in their spacious house on the prosperous side of town .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: are the experiences of the main character profound , or simply routine ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: kids will love its fantasy and adventure , and grownups should appreciate its whimsical humor .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:"]

Sentence Classification Task: Distinguish between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that express personal perspectives or emotions.

Your goal is to evaluate each sentence and categorize it as either subjective, indicating the presence of personal views or emotional tone, or objective, signifying a neutral, evidence-based presentation of information. Clearly mark your classification as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to indicate whether the sentence conveys personal opinions and feelings or factual, unbiased information.

This classification exercise demands a careful examination of the sentence's content and tone to determine whether it presents verifiable facts in a neutral manner or conveys the writer's feelings, beliefs, or biases. Your goal is to meticulously evaluate each sentence and then label it as either <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if it maintains a neutral, evidence-based tone or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if it embodies a personal, emotional, or biased perspective, ensuring that your classification reflects the sentence's inherent nature.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

Sentence Classification Task: Distinguish between sentences that present information in a neutral, fact-based manner and those that express personal perspectives or emotions.

Your task is to analyze each sentence and determine whether it presents a neutral, fact-based perspective or a personal, emotive tone. To achieve this, identify sentences that are grounded in evidence and verifiable data, and label them as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, while sentences that convey personal views, sentiments, or emotional undertones should be labeled as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, thereby distinguishing between factual and personal narratives.\n\nInput: jamie has a `` to-do `` list for her life and also a very big secret she must keep from landon .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: there \'s only one thing his cousin did n\'t tell him . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: when she fails to find the `` perfect man `` that will make her happy , she decides to construct him herself , using parts from different people .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: bolstered by an astonishing voice cast ( excepting love hewitt ) , an interesting racial tension , and a storyline that i have n\'t encountered since at least pete \'s dragon .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they \'re each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they \'re each interesting" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal opinion about the stories being interesting. \n\nThe sentence "the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll" can also be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it contains personal judgments about the movie being "well shot", "tragic", and worth pondering, which are all subjective evaluations.\n\nInput:', "To master the art of sentence classification, it's essential to develop a keen sense of linguistic awareness, recognizing the subtle distinction between sentences that convey factual, unbiased information and those that betray the writer's emotional leanings, personal convictions, or inherent prejudices. This delicate task necessitates a thoughtful dissection of each sentence, scrutinizing its underlying message, tone, and language to discern whether it presents a balanced, fact-driven narrative or a skewed, opinionated one. The ultimate goal is to assign a dual classification to each sentence, designating it as either <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if it upholds a neutral, evidence-based stance, devoid of emotional undertones, or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if it exudes a personal, emotive, or biased quality, thereby ensuring that your categorization accurately captures the sentence's intrinsic essence and its susceptibility to individual interpretation or emotional influence.\n\nInput:"]

Accurately categorizing sentences as subjective or objective requires a nuanced understanding of the language used, distinguishing between fact-based, unbiased information and expressions of personal opinion, emotion, or prejudice. This classification exercise demands a careful examination of the sentence's content and tone to determine whether it presents verifiable facts in a neutral manner or conveys the writer's feelings, beliefs, or biases. Your goal is to meticulously evaluate each sentence and then label it as either <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if it maintains a neutral, evidence-based tone or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if it embodies a personal, emotional, or biased perspective, ensuring that your classification reflects the sentence's inherent nature.

Analyze the sentence to decide whether it presents verifiable information in a neutral tone, or if it conveys a personal perspective, and then classify it accordingly. Your task is to discern whether the sentence is grounded in evidence and observable facts, or if it reflects individual sentiments and viewpoints.

This classification is due to the presence of personal opinions and biases within the sentence. The use of the phrase "ken russell would love this" implies a personal opinion about someone\'s potential enjoyment or approval of a scene or film. Additionally, the description of a scene as "a double-barreled rip-off of quentin tarantino\'s climactic shootout" expresses a subjective judgment about the originality or creativity of the scene, suggesting that it is derivative or unoriginal. The tone of the sentence is also informal and expressive, with the use of colloquial language like "meat loaf explodes," which further indicates a subjective and personal perspective rather than a neutral, fact-based report.\n\nInput: matches neorealism \'s impact by showing the humanity of a war-torn land filled with people who just want to live their lives .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "matches neorealism \'s impact by showing the humanity of a war-torn land filled with people who just want to live their lives" should be labeled as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. This classification is due to the sentence expressing a personal interpretation or opinion about the impact of neorealism and the portrayal of humanity in a war-torn setting, rather than providing a neutral, fact-based statement. The use of phrases like "matches neorealism\'s impact" and "showing the humanity" indicates an analysis or evaluation that is influenced by the speaker\'s perspective, making the sentence subjective.\n\nInput: the tuxedo was n\'t just bad ; it was , as my friend david cross would call it , \'hungry-man portions of bad \' .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "" should be labeled as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>.

Respond with the classification of the sentence in the format <final_answer>classification</final_answer>, choosing 'objective' for sentences that are fact-based and 'subjective' for those that reflect personal perspectives, thus identifying the underlying sentiment and tone of the given sentence.

Accurately categorizing sentences as subjective or objective requires a nuanced understanding of the language used, distinguishing between fact-based, unbiased information and expressions of personal opinion, emotion, or prejudice. This classification exercise demands a careful examination of the sentence's content and tone to determine whether it presents verifiable facts in a neutral manner or conveys the writer's feelings, beliefs, or biases. Your goal is to meticulously evaluate each sentence and then label it as either <final_answer>objective</final_answer> if it maintains a neutral, evidence-based tone or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> if it embodies a personal, emotional, or biased perspective, ensuring that your classification reflects the sentence's inherent nature.

😶Generated Prompts: ['To accomplish this classification task, you will need to carefully examine the tone and language used in each sentence, discerning between those that convey information in a detached, factual manner and those that betray a personal bias, sentiment, or emotional resonance. Your goal is to sort these sentences into two distinct categories: one for sentences that present information in a neutral, evidence-based way, and another for sentences that express a more personal, subjective viewpoint. As you evaluate each sentence, consider whether it relies on verifiable data and objective evidence or if it conveys a personal opinion, emotion, or evaluation. Sentences that are grounded in factual information and lack personal sentiment should be labeled as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, while sentences that express personal views, emotions, or biases should be categorized as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, allowing you to effectively differentiate between sentences that provide factual information and those that convey personal perspectives.\n\nInput: it \'s a celebration of self-confidence and a slap in the face of a society that cherises impossibly unnatural physical perfection .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAfter examining the sentence, I would categorize it as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. The language used, such as "celebration of self-confidence" and "slap in the face of a society", conveys a personal opinion and emotional tone, indicating a biased viewpoint. The sentence also expresses a value judgment about societal beauty standards, which is a subjective evaluation. Additionally, the use of the phrase "impossibly unnatural physical perfection" suggests a personal perspective on what is considered beautiful or acceptable. Overall, the sentence does not present a neutral, evidence-based statement, but rather a personal opinion or sentiment.\n\nInput: as reality bleeds into hallucination , rothko decides to take the man for a walk . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: his father , aglanar , was happy at his birth that he would have a strong and honorable son to carry on the traditions of the valley .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the remaining friends must now rescue the captives , while desperately trying to avoid the long arm of the law .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: rugged contractor rick eyes beth but ends up going home with the more assertive debby .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nAfter examining the given sentence, I would categorize it as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThe sentence "suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative" expresses a personal opinion about the narrative quality of the film, using words like "compelling" which is a subjective evaluation. \n\nThe second part of the sentence, "still, as a visual treat, the film is almost unsurpassed" also expresses a personal viewpoint, using the phrase "visual treat" which is an emotional and subjective description, and "almost unsurpassed" which implies a personal opinion about the film\'s visual quality. \n\nOverall, the sentence conveys personal opinions and emotions, rather than providing factual information, making it subjective.\n\nInput:', "To determine the nature of a sentence, you need to evaluate whether it conveys information in a neutral and factual way or if it embodies the author's emotions, opinions, or biases.
