😶Generated Prompts: ['Classify the sentiment of the provided sentence, distinguishing between objective statements that provide verifiable evidence and subjective expressions that convey personal opinions or emotions, and enclose your determination, either \'objective\' for fact-based sentences or \'subjective\' for opinion-driven sentences, within <final_answer> tags for a clear response.\n\nInput: day in , day out , the same routine is repeated .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "day in, day out, the same routine is repeated" can be classified as a statement that observes a pattern or a fact without expressing a clear personal opinion or emotion about the routine being good, bad, or otherwise. It simply states a repetition of activities, which can be verified if one observes the routine in question. Therefore, it leans towards being an objective statement as it reports on a state of affairs without overt emotional tone or personal judgment.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: peralta \'s mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Label the given sentence as either subjective or objective by discerning whether it presents a personal viewpoint, emotion, or opinion, or if it conveys factual, evidence-based information, and then enclose your classification, which should be either \'objective\' for factual sentences or \'subjective\' for sentences expressing personal perspectives, within <final_answer> tags, ensuring the response is limited to the classification itself, either \'objective\' or \'subjective\', between the tags.\n\nInput: suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n\'t . it \'s just incredibly dull .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence provided contains a personal opinion about a film, "waiting for happiness," stating that it is "incredibly dull." This evaluation is based on the speaker\'s subjective experience and emotional response to the film, rather than on verifiable facts or objective criteria. Therefore, the sentiment expressed is subjective, as it reflects the speaker\'s personal perspective or opinion about the film\'s quality.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: peralta \'s mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>\n\nInput: lieutenant hart must then defend the black pilot against charges before an obviously racist american tribunal ; unaware that the trial itself is only a front for the real secret of the prison camp .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Evaluate the tone and content of the provided sentence to distinguish between objective, fact-based information presented in a neutral tone, and subjective expressions that convey personal opinions, emotions, or biases. Categorize the sentence as either objective, if it provides verifiable information without emotional undertones, or subjective, if it includes personal judgments or feelings. Your assessment should result in one of two classifications: \'objective\' for sentences lacking personal perspective, or \'subjective\' for those that embody opinionated or emotional language. Format your response with the classification, either \'objective\' or \'subjective\', enclosed within <final_answer> </final_answer> tags, as in <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, to denote the sentence\'s nature clearly.\n\nInput: when they goes to the fence to get them , they discover that someone stole them .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo evaluate the tone and content of the provided sentence, "when they goes to the fence to get them , they discover that someone stole them," let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **Tone**: The tone seems neutral as it reports an event without expressing a clear emotion or personal opinion about the event itself. However, the use of "stole" implies a negative action, which could slightly tint the tone, but it\'s more of a factual report than an emotional expression.\n\n2. **Content**: The sentence describes an action and its consequence. It states that someone stole "them" (referring to unspecified objects), which is a verifiable action. The sentence does not express a personal judgment about the event or the people involved beyond the fact that stealing occurred, which is generally considered negative.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence primarily provides information about an event without expressing a personal opinion or emotion directly. The negative connotation of "stole" is inherent to the action itself rather than an injected opinion.\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: with wit and empathy to spare , waydowntown acknowledges the silent screams of workaday inertia but stops short of indulging its characters \' striving solipsism .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: wanker goths are on the loose ! run for your lives !\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: by presenting an impossible romance in an impossible world , pumpkin dares us to say why either is impossible -- which forces us to confront what \'s possible and what we might do to make it so .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "To categorize a sentence, analyze its content to distinguish between a personal perspective, which would be labeled as 'subjective', and factual information, which is considered 'objective'. The distinction hinges on the presence of personal opinions, emotional undertones, or biased judgments in the sentence, versus the presentation of verifiable data without emotional influence. Your classification should be presented in the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, clearly indicating whether the sentence is subjective or objective based on its content and tone.\n\nInput: entwined with maggie 's search for hope , the film explores her interaction with her family and friends .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: bernal 's transformation from naive priest to tortured adulterer to hard-nosed careerist is riveting .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:"]

Ensure your response adheres to the specified format: <final_answer>subjective or objective</final_answer>, clearly indicating the sentence\'s nature based on the distinction between subjective and objective language.\n\nInput: but sometimes what we teach our children can be as deadly as not teaching them .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: but cousin roberto is n\'t the tough guy they \'d expected .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: when she fails to find the `` perfect man `` that will make her happy , she decides to construct him herself , using parts from different people .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence is subjective or objective, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence describes a character\'s actions and decisions in a narrative manner. The use of the phrase "the \'perfect man\'" could imply a subjective interpretation of what perfection entails, as perfection is often subjective and varies from person to person.\n\n2. **Evaluative Language**: The term "perfect" is evaluative, as it implies a judgment about what constitutes an ideal partner. This kind of language introduces a subjective element because the concept of perfection is not universally defined.\n\n3. **Neutral vs. Emotional Tone**: The sentence does not convey a strongly emotional tone but rather presents a scenario in a somewhat matter-of-fact way. However, the concept of constructing a "perfect man" from parts of different people introduces a fantastical or satirical element that might be interpreted as having a slightly humorous or critical undertone, depending on the context.\n\n4. **Personal Viewpoint**: The sentence seems to present a character\'s decision-making process without explicitly endorsing or criticizing her actions. However, the narrative choice to highlight her decision to "construct him herself" might reflect a personal viewpoint on themes such as relationships, happiness, or the search for an ideal\n\nInput: it has the ability to offend and put off everyone , but it holds you with its outrageousness .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal viewpoint and emotional tone through the use of words like "offend," "put off," and "outrageousness," which convey a sense of strong opinion and evaluation. The phrase "but it holds you" also suggests a personal experience or reaction, indicating that the statement is not purely factual but rather an interpretation or opinion of the subject in question. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective due to its use of evaluative language and expression of personal viewpoint.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Sentence categorization challenge: determine whether a given sentence presents information in a neutral, factual manner or expresses a personal viewpoint.

The use of the phrase "if you love the music" and "and i do" indicates a personal preference, and the statement "its hard to imagine having more fun" is a subjective judgment about the enjoyment of watching a documentary. \n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. **"in its understanding"** - This phrase suggests a perspective or interpretation, which could imply subjectivity.\n2. **"often funny way"** - The use of "funny" introduces a subjective judgment about the manner in which something is told. Humor is highly subjective and varies greatly from person to person.\n3. **"it tells a story"** - This part of the sentence is more neutral and could be either subjective or objective depending on the context of the story.\n4. **"whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation"** - This part of the sentence suggests an objective validation based on observable changes in the nation\'s composition. It implies that there are verifiable facts supporting the story\'s restatement.\n\nGiven these points, while the sentence does contain elements that could be considered objective (like the validation by the changing composition of the nation), the overall tone and some of the descriptors ("often funny way") introduce a level of subjectivity. The sentence reflects a personal judgment or interpretation, especially in how it characterizes the way the story is told.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` the best disney movie since the lion king ``\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Classify the sentiment of a given sentence as either subjective, which encompasses personal viewpoints, feelings, or appraisals, or objective, which presents verifiable information without bias.

To categorize a sentence, analyze its content to distinguish between a personal perspective, which would be labeled as 'subjective', and factual information, which is considered 'objective'. The distinction hinges on the presence of personal opinions, emotional undertones, or biased judgments in the sentence, versus the presentation of verifiable data without emotional influence. Your classification should be presented in the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, clearly indicating whether the sentence is subjective or objective based on its content and tone.

To tackle this challenge, you'll need to evaluate the tone and content of a given sentence, discerning whether it conveys information in a detached, factual way - which would earn it an 'objective' label - or if it incorporates personal biases, sentiments, or viewpoints, thereby qualifying as 'subjective'.

When you've made your determination, format your response as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present neutral, verifiable information or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that embody personal perspectives or feelings.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To categorize a sentence, analyze its content to distinguish between a personal perspective, which would be labeled as 'subjective', and factual information, which is considered 'objective'. The distinction hinges on the presence of personal opinions, emotional undertones, or biased judgments in the sentence, versus the presentation of verifiable data without emotional influence. Your classification should be presented in the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, clearly indicating whether the sentence is subjective or objective based on its content and tone.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Develop a classification system to categorize sentences into two distinct groups: subjective and objective. This entails scrutinizing the sentence\'s meaning to separate personal viewpoints from factual, verifiable details. The key to this differentiation lies in identifying the presence of emotional language, personal biases, or value judgments, which are hallmarks of subjective sentences, as opposed to objective sentences that convey information in a neutral, fact-based manner. To accomplish this, carefully examine the linguistic features and tone of the given sentence, and then render a judgment in the specified format, <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, to denote whether the sentence expresses a personal opinion or presents information in an unbiased, factual way.\n\nInput: rarely has so much money delivered so little entertainment .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: if a horror movie \'s primary goal is to frighten and disturb , then they works spectacularly well . . . a shiver-inducing , nerve-rattling ride .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: a dark comedy that goes for sick and demented humor simply to do so . the movie is without intent .\nOutput: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: adapted from a monologue in his `` blue jam `` radio series , chris morris \' first short film is a haunting black comedy about a man who no longer uses his name because he \'s decided he \'s ceased to deserve one , and a dog called rothko who says he is the man \'s lawyer .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components and tone:\n\n1. **Source and Context**: The sentence mentions a specific work ("blue jam" radio series) and a creator (Chris Morris), which provides context but does not inherently bias the sentence towards being subjective or objective.\n2. **Descriptive Language**: The use of "haunting black comedy" introduces a subjective interpretation of the film\'s genre and impact. The term "haunting" can evoke a sense of eeriness or profound effect, which is a subjective experience.\n3. **Character and Plot Description**: The description of the man and the dog named Rothko who claims to be the man\'s lawyer is factual within the context of the story but does not carry emotional or value judgment beyond the narrative\'s setup.\n4. **Tone and Emotional Language**: The overall tone seems to be informative, aiming to describe the premise of the film. However, the choice of words like "haunting" introduces a layer of subjective interpretation.\n\nGiven these observations, the sentence contains elements of both subjective interpretation (through the use of "haunting") and objective description (in outlining the plot and characters). However, the presence of emotional language ("haunting black comedy") tips the balance towards the sentence\n\nInput: ronnie schwann , a young man regarded as `` slow , `` has affections for sarah , a young woman who stays at hope house , a facility for the mentally ill .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo classify the given sentence, let\'s analyze its components and tone:\n\n1. **Linguistic Features and Tone**: The sentence describes Ronnie Schwann as a "young man regarded as \'slow\'," which could imply a subjective judgment about his intellectual abilities or speed of understanding. However, the term "regarded as" suggests that this is a perception or opinion held by others, rather than an objective fact. The description of Sarah and her residence at "Hope House, a facility for the mentally ill" provides more factual information about her living situation without expressing a personal opinion about her character or the quality of the facility.\n\n2. **Emotional Language and Personal Biases**: The use of the term "slow" to describe Ronnie could be seen as having a slightly negative connotation, implying a personal bias or judgment. However, in the context of the sentence, it seems more to be setting the scene or providing background information rather than expressing the author\'s opinion. The overall tone of the sentence is more informative than evaluative.\n\n3. **Value Judgments**: The sentence does not explicitly contain value judgments about Ronnie\'s feelings for Sarah or the nature of their relationship. It simply states that Ronnie has affections for Sarah, which is a factual report of his\n\nInput:', 'Analyze the given sentence to discern its tone and intent, distinguishing between objective statements that convey factual information devoid of personal influence and subjective expressions that embody personal viewpoints, emotions, or evaluative judgments.

[ but ] the script goes wrong at several key junctures .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe given sentence expresses a personal viewpoint about an individual\'s ability to charm when given the right lines, indicating a subjective evaluation of their performance. Additionally, it criticizes the script, stating that it "goes wrong," which further suggests a personal judgment rather than an objective assessment. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective due to the presence of personal opinions and evaluative judgments.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: steve \'s best friend , sean , on the other hand , has n\'t been so lucky .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: soon , annie \'s condition helps leoncio \'s children realize the essence of a family .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, "soon, Annie\'s condition helps Leoncio\'s children realize the essence of a family," we need to break it down into its components and assess whether it conveys factual information or personal viewpoints.\n\n1. **Subject Matter**: The sentence discusses a situation involving characters (Annie and Leoncio\'s children) and a realization they come to regarding the essence of a family. This context suggests a narrative or thematic exploration rather than a factual report.\n\n2. **Language and Tone**: The use of the word "essence" implies a deeper, more abstract understanding of family, which is a subjective concept. The realization of such an essence is a personal or emotional understanding rather than a factual discovery.\n\n3. **Intent**: The intent here seems to be to convey a thematic or emotional message about family, rather than to inform about a verifiable fact. The sentence appears to be part of a narrative designed to evoke emotions or thoughts about the importance of family, which is a subjective interpretation.\n\n4. **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity**: Objective statements are typically verifiable and lack personal bias. In contrast, this sentence involves a personal or emotional realization, which cannot be universally verified and is influenced by the context of the story or the perspectives\n\nInput: god responds to his challenge and allows bruce to take on his powers to prove himself .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, "God responds to his challenge and allows Bruce to take on his powers to prove himself," we must consider its components and the context it implies.\n\n1. **Subject Matter**: The sentence involves a deity ("God") and a character named Bruce, suggesting a narrative or fictional context. The interaction between God and Bruce, particularly the act of God responding to a challenge and granting powers, is typical of mythological, religious, or comic book storylines.\n\n2. **Tone and Intent**: The tone appears to be narrative or descriptive, aiming to convey a sequence of events or actions within a story. The intent seems to be informative about the plot or character development, specifically focusing on Bruce\'s journey or test.\n\n3. **Objectivity vs. Subjectivity**: \n   - **Objective Statements** are factual, verifiable, and unbiased. They present information without personal influence.\n   - **Subjective Statements** include personal opinions, feelings, or biased perspectives. They are based on individual viewpoints and can vary from person to person.\n\nGiven these definitions, the sentence "God responds to his challenge and allows Bruce to take on his powers to prove himself" can be analyzed as follows:\n\n- The sentence describes a specific event or action involving\n\nInput: barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: just when it seems martha \'s influence may be having a favorable effect on greg \'s attitude , his old ways win out .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: nete forces a doctor to tell her how much time he has left .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Sentence classification task: Assess the given sentence to distinguish between objective statements that present verifiable facts without bias and subjective expressions that embody personal viewpoints, sentiments, or emotional undertones.

Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Classify sentences into two primary categories based on their tone and intent: sentences that provide information in a neutral, factual manner, which should be labeled as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, and sentences that express personal viewpoints, emotions, or evaluations, which should be marked as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. This distinction is crucial for understanding whether a sentence aims to inform with verifiable evidence or to persuade with personal opinions and feelings, thereby enabling the identification of the underlying sentiment and purpose behind each sentence.\n\nInput: in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "in its understanding , often funny way , it tells a story whose restatement is validated by the changing composition of the nation" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThis classification is due to the presence of the phrase "often funny way", which introduces a personal evaluation of the manner in which the story is told, indicating that the sentence expresses a viewpoint or opinion rather than simply providing factual information.\n\nInput: lieutenant hart must then defend the black pilot against charges before an obviously racist american tribunal ; unaware that the trial itself is only a front for the real secret of the prison camp .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: police and investigators believed the murders were in retaliation for a robbery days prior to the murders .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: barney has created a tour de force that is weird , wacky and wonderful .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "Barney has created a tour de force that is weird, wacky and wonderful" should be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. This classification is due to the use of evaluative adjectives such as "weird," "wacky," and "wonderful," which express a personal viewpoint or opinion about Barney\'s creation, rather than providing a neutral, factual description.\n\nInput: his family decides to go back on a holiday to india for 2 weeks , when tina discovers the truth about pooja \'s e-mails , they decide together that tina will play along with the charade .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes" should be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. This classification is due to the use of emotive language such as "aching beauty" and the expression of a personal emotional response ("brings tears to your eyes"), which indicates a personal viewpoint or evaluation rather than a neutral, factual report.\n\nInput: now he thinks he is seeing things that are n\'t there and if things do n\'t improve , she will take their only son and leave .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Develop a classification system to categorize sentences as either objective or subjective by determining whether they convey factual, unbiased information or express personal viewpoints, sentiments, or judgments, and label them accordingly as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for fact-based content and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for content that reflects the writer\'s emotions, opinions, or evaluations, effectively differentiating between informative and persuasive or emotive sentences.\n\nInput: `` the best disney movie since the lion king ``\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "the best disney movie since the lion king" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. This classification is due to the presence of the word "best," which expresses a personal viewpoint or opinion. The comparison to "the lion king" also implies a judgment based on personal taste or evaluation, rather than providing factual, unbiased information.\n\nInput: are the experiences of the main character profound , or simply routine ?\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: suffering from his flashbacks , vince does n\'t realize that ellen has also disappeared from the cemetery , right before his eyes .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: there \'s only one thing his cousin did n\'t tell him . . .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: part of the draw of dance is the impossibility to define its particular joy . tavernier \'s film conveys a large element of its appeal -- and more .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "part of the draw of dance is the impossibility to define its particular joy" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal viewpoint about the appeal of dance, using phrases like "part of the draw" and "particular joy" that convey a sense of emotional or personal connection.\n\nThe sentence "tavernier\'s film conveys a large element of its appeal -- and more" can also be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal evaluation or opinion about the film, using phrases like "conveys a large element of its appeal" that imply a value judgment or interpretation. The phrase "and more" also suggests a level of enthusiasm or endorsement that is characteristic of subjective language.\n\nInput: when they goes to the fence to get them , they discover that someone stole them .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "when they goes to the fence to get them , they discover that someone stole them" can be classified as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>. \n\nThis classification is based on the fact that the sentence reports an event (the theft of items) without expressing a personal viewpoint, sentiment, or judgment about the event. The sentence sticks to conveying what happened without inserting any emotional tone or bias, making it a factual, objective statement.\n\nInput:', "Determine the tone of the provided sentence, deciding whether it conveys information in an impartial, factual way or if it incorporates personal feelings, opinions, or assessments.

To determine the tone of a given sentence, you must discern whether it conveys factual, unbiased information or if it embodies personal perspectives, sentiments, or appraisals. Your goal is to classify sentences into two distinct categories: those that present information in a detached, evidence-based manner and those that convey a personal stance, feeling, or assessment. In your response, use <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to denote sentences that are grounded in fact and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for sentences that reflect opinion, emotion, or personal judgment, thereby clarifying the sentence's underlying intent and emotional resonance.

Input: you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they 're each interesting . the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sentence "you have to pay attention to follow all the stories , but they 're each interesting" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal opinion about the stories being interesting. 

The sentence "the movie is well shot and very tragic , and one to ponder after the credits roll" can also be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it contains personal judgments about the movie being "well shot", "tragic", and worth pondering, which are all subjective evaluations.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

To determine the nature of a given sentence, it's essential to discern whether the language used is impartial and based on verifiable evidence or if it reflects personal sentiments, biases, or emotional undertones. The classification process involves evaluating the sentence's tone and content to categorize it as either objective, where the information is presented in a neutral and fact-based manner, or subjective, where the language is influenced by personal opinions, feelings, or prejudices. Your task is to analyze the sentence carefully and then classify it as either objective, indicating a neutral and evidence-based tone, or subjective, signifying a tone that is personal, emotional, or biased. Ensure your classification is formatted as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that present information neutrally and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for those that convey personal views or biases.

To determine the nature of a sentence, examine its wording and tone to separate fact from personal viewpoint. The crucial difference between subjective and objective sentences hinges on the presence of emotional language, personal beliefs, or prejudiced views, which signify a subjective tone, versus the neutral presentation of evidence-based information, which defines an objective tone. By applying your knowledge of the distinction between subjective and objective language, assess whether the provided sentence conveys verifiable evidence in a neutral manner (objective) or conveys personal opinions, feelings, or biased assessments (subjective). Classify the sentence as either subjective or objective, using the format <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> to clearly denote its tone and content.

Ensure your response is in the format: <final_answer>classification</final_answer>, selecting 'objective' for factual sentences and 'subjective' for those influenced by personal perspectives.\n\nInput: the lizard , chaos , scar , heartless and sic inhabit the violent and often bizarre world of backyard wrestling .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: his odyssey finally leads him onto a theatre stage .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: the only thing that matters for him is break dancing .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: but cousin roberto is n't the tough guy they 'd expected .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: deacon , matt and fred will do anything for even a glimpse of sex and spend their mornings pirating porno movies from fred 's after school job at the video store .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: amanda is faced with making right decisions amidst trying circumstances .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:", 'Analyze the given sentence to determine whether it expresses a personal viewpoint, sentiment, or emotional tone, in which case it should be labeled as \'subjective\', or if it presents information based on verifiable evidence without any personal bias, making it \'objective\'. Ensure your response is formatted with the classification, either \'subjective\' or \'objective\', enclosed within <final_answer> tags, like this: <final_answer>your classification</final_answer>, to clearly indicate whether the sentence is a factual statement or an expression of personal opinion or feeling.\n\nInput: it \'s not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n\'t . it \'s just incredibly dull .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "it\'s not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn\'t. it\'s just incredibly dull." expresses a personal viewpoint regarding the quality and entertainment value of a film. The use of the word "dull" to describe the film indicates a subjective judgment about the film\'s ability to engage or interest the viewer. This kind of evaluation is based on personal taste and experience, rather than on objective, verifiable criteria. Therefore, the sentence should be classified as subjective because it reflects the speaker\'s personal opinion or sentiment about the film.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` the best disney movie since the lion king ``\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "the best Disney movie since the Lion King" expresses a comparison and an evaluation of quality, which is inherently subjective because "best" is a matter of personal opinion. The Lion King is used as a benchmark, implying that the speaker holds it in high regard, but the judgment of what constitutes "the best" can vary greatly from person to person. Therefore, this statement reflects a personal viewpoint or sentiment rather than a fact that can be verified with objective evidence.\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput: amanda is faced with making right decisions amidst trying circumstances .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo determine whether the sentence "Amanda is faced with making right decisions amidst trying circumstances" is subjective or objective, let\'s analyze its components:\n\n1. **Subject**: The sentence is about Amanda, a specific individual, which could imply a personal or subjective perspective. However, the subject itself does not necessarily make the statement subjective.\n2. **Action**: Amanda is "faced with making right decisions," which implies a challenge or a situation she is in. The phrase "making right decisions" suggests an evaluation or judgment about the nature of the decisions, which could introduce a subjective element since what constitutes a "right" decision can vary based on personal beliefs or values.\n3. **Context**: The phrase "amidst trying circumstances" adds a descriptive layer to Amanda\'s situation, indicating that the conditions are difficult. This description of the circumstances as "trying" could be seen as an interpretation or subjective evaluation of the situation, as the perception of difficulty can vary from person to person.\n\nGiven these considerations, the sentence does express a viewpoint on Amanda\'s situation and the nature of her decisions and circumstances, which involves an interpretation or evaluation. Therefore, it should be classified as subjective because it implies a judgment about what is "right" and describes the circumstances with\n\nInput: as the day unfolds , the decisions become clearer and yet more difficult to make as the characters question what the true meaning of their lives are .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nTo analyze the given sentence, we must consider whether it presents a personal viewpoint, sentiment, or emotional tone, or if it provides information based on verifiable evidence without personal bias.\n\nThe sentence discusses characters questioning the true meaning of their lives, which suggests an exploration of themes or plot elements often found in literature, film, or other narrative forms. The phrase "as the day unfolds" and the description of decisions becoming "clearer and yet more difficult to make" imply a narrative progression or character development. The sentence does not express a direct opinion about these elements but rather describes a situation or plot point.\n\nHowever, the interpretation of characters\' questioning of the "true meaning of their lives" could be seen as having a slightly subjective tone because it implies a depth of introspection and existential questioning that might be perceived differently by various readers or viewers. Yet, the sentence itself does not express a personal viewpoint on this introspection but rather states it as a part of the narrative.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentence leans more towards being a description of a narrative or thematic element rather than an expression of personal opinion or emotion. It presents a scenario without overt judgment or emotional tone, aiming to inform or describe rather than persuade or express a sentiment.\n\n<final_answer>objective\n\nInput: tong is sent back to fetch some things for devlin and unknowingly tries on devlin \'s tuxedo and finds that it gives extraordinary powers to anyone that dons the suit .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Accurately categorizing sentences into subjective or objective classifications requires a nuanced understanding of the language used, distinguishing between statements that present verifiable facts and those that convey personal opinions or emotional inclinations. This process entails a detailed examination of the sentence\'s language to ascertain whether it embodies a neutral, fact-driven tone or if it is colored by individual perspectives, biases, or sentimental undertones. The goal is to assess the sentence\'s content and tone to determine its classification as either objective, where information is presented in an unbiased and verifiable manner, or subjective, where the expression is influenced by personal sentiments, judgments, or prejudices. Your objective is to meticulously evaluate the sentence and subsequently classify it as either <final_answer>objective</final_answer>, denoting a neutral and fact-based presentation, or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, indicating a presentation that is influenced by personal views, emotions, or biases, based on the distinction between factual, unbiased information and the expression of personal opinions or biases.\n\nInput: steve \'s best friend , sean , on the other hand , has n\'t been so lucky .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: offers 102 minutes of breezy , occasionally very funny entertainment .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "offers 102 minutes of breezy, occasionally very funny entertainment" is classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThe reasoning behind this classification is that the sentence includes the words "breezy" and "funny," which are subjective terms that can vary in interpretation from person to person. What one individual finds funny or breezy, another might not. This indicates that the sentence is expressing a personal opinion or sentiment rather than presenting verifiable, factual information.\n\nInput: this event leads to deep thoughts about marriage , friendship , relationships and last not least life itself .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: after baptizing their amnesiac boy-toy chris , the infamous pair takes him on a grand tour of their wild nightlife frolic , their spontaneous media extravaganza and their dazzling diva lifestyle in order to help him find his identity and his way home .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput: life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "life on the rez is no picnic : this picture shows you why" can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThe phrase "is no picnic" is an idiomatic expression that implies difficulty or hardship, which introduces a subjective interpretation of life on the reservation. The use of this phrase suggests a negative perspective or opinion about life on the reservation, rather than presenting a neutral or fact-based description. Additionally, the phrase "this picture shows you why" implies that the image is being used to support or illustrate a personal viewpoint or opinion, further indicating a subjective tone. Overall, the sentence conveys a personal sentiment or judgment about life on the reservation, rather than presenting verifiable facts in a neutral manner.\n\nInput: this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "this fascinating look at israel in ferment feels as immediate as the latest news footage from gaza and , because of its heightened , well-shaped dramas , twice as powerful" is classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>. \n\nThe reasoning behind this classification is as follows:\n- The use of the word "fascinating" introduces a personal opinion or emotional inclination, as what one person finds fascinating, another might not.\n- The comparison of the look at Israel to "the latest news footage from Gaza" and the description of dramas as "heightened" and "well-shaped" suggests a value judgment that is subjective.\n- The phrase "twice as powerful" is also a subjective evaluation, as the measurement of power in this context is not quantifiable or universally agreed upon, but rather dependent on individual interpretation.\n- Overall, the sentence\'s tone and language convey a personal perspective or opinion, rather than presenting verifiable facts in a neutral manner.\n\nInput: after a drastic confrontation with the \'normal \' outside world that results in fighting and panic , the group breaks up .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\nThe sentence "after a drastic confrontation with the \'normal \' outside world that results in fighting and panic , the group breaks up" can be classified as <final_answer>objective</final_answer>.\n\nReasoning: \nThe sentence describes a sequence of events and their consequences without expressing a personal opinion or emotional inclination. It reports on actions (confrontation, fighting, panic, the group breaking up) in a neutral tone, focusing on what happened rather than how the events should be perceived or judged. The use of words like "drastic" might suggest a degree of intensity but does not necessarily introduce a subjective bias into the description of the events. The overall presentation is fact-driven, aiming to inform about the occurrence and outcome of the confrontation without expressing a personal viewpoint or sentiment.\n\nInput: he dies alone at the hospital , and apparently everything nete planned went wrong .\nOutput: <final_answer>objective</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Develop a classification system to categorize sentences into two distinct categories: subjective and objective. This entails a nuanced evaluation of the sentence's language, focusing on the presence or absence of emotional undertones, personal biases, and verifiable evidence. The primary goal is to discern whether a sentence presents information in a factual, unbiased manner or if it embodies personal opinions, sentiments, or prejudiced perspectives. To achieve this, scrutinize the sentence for indicators of subjectivity, such as emotional language, personal beliefs, or biased viewpoints, which contrast with the neutral, evidence-based presentation characteristic of objective sentences. Upon analyzing the sentence's tone and content, render a judgment on whether it aligns with the criteria for objective or subjective classification, and format your response as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> or <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> to signify the sentence's categorization.\n\nInput: this is scorsese 's finest work , and one of the best films of 2002 .\nOutput: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>\n\n<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>\n\nInput:"]
