The phrase "raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum" suggests that the film is considered better than typical children\'s fantasy, which is a positive comparison.\n2. "Allen\'s astringent wit" implies that the humor in the film is sharp and biting, which is generally seen as a positive attribute, especially for those who appreciate this type of humor.\n\nThe overall tone of the review is appreciative of the film\'s quality and humor, indicating a positive sentiment.

Output: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>

Input: like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen 's astringent wit .
Output: user
Let's break down the review to understand its emotional content:

1. The phrase "raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum" suggests that the film is considered better than typical children's fantasy, which is a positive comparison.
2. "Allen's astringent wit" implies that the humor in the film is sharp and biting, which is generally seen as a positive attribute, especially for those who appreciate this type of humor.

The overall tone of the review is appreciative of the film's quality and humor, indicating a positive sentiment. However, it is not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, which would be required for a "very positive" classification.

Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the review is positive.

<final_answer>positive</final_answer>

Input: like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels .
Output: user
Let's break down the review to understand its emotional content:

1. "like an afterschool special" - This comparison suggests that the film might be simplistic or overly moralistic, which is generally not a positive connotation.
2. "with costumes by gianni versace" - This part is positive, indicating that the film has high-quality, visually appealing costumes.
3. "mad love looks better than it feels" - This suggests that while the film may look good visually, the emotional or narrative content does not resonate as well.

Overall, the review seems to be pointing out a discrepancy between the film's visual appeal and its emotional or narrative quality. The tone is somewhat critical, but not harshly so. It acknowledges the film's aesthetic strengths while expressing disappointment in its emotional impact.

Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the review is more on the negative side, but not extremely so. Therefore, the classification would be:

Input: combines improbable melodrama -lrb- gored bullfighters , comatose ballerinas -rrb- with subtly kinky bedside vigils and sensational denouements , and yet at the end , we are undeniably touched .
Output: user
To determine the sentiment of this movie review, let's break down the key points:

1. The review mentions "improbable melodrama" and "subtly kinky bedside vigils," which might suggest a somewhat unconventional or unusual approach to storytelling. This could be seen as a mixed sentiment, as it's not entirely positive or negative.

2. The phrase "sensational denouements" indicates that the ending of the movie is impactful or exciting, which is generally a positive sentiment.

3. The reviewer states, "at the end, we are undeniably touched," which suggests that the movie had an emotional impact on the viewer. This is a positive sentiment, as it implies that the movie successfully connected with the audience on an emotional level.

Considering these points, the overall sentiment of the review seems to lean towards a positive direction, despite the unconventional elements mentioned. The reviewer acknowledges the movie's unique aspects but ultimately finds it emotionally resonant.

Output: user
To determine the sentiment of this movie review, let's break down the key points:

1. The review mentions "improbable melodrama" and "subtly kinky bedside vigils," which might suggest a somewhat unconventional or unusual approach to storytelling. This could be seen as a mixed sentiment, as it's not entirely positive or negative.

2. The phrase "sensational denouements" indicates that the ending of the movie is impactful or exciting, which is generally a positive sentiment.

3. The reviewer states, "at the end, we are undeniably touched," which suggests that the movie had an emotional impact on the viewer. This is a positive sentiment, as it implies that the movie successfully connected with the audience on an emotional level.

Considering these points, the overall sentiment of the review seems to lean towards a positive direction, despite the unconventional elements mentioned. The reviewer acknowledges the movie's unique aspects but ultimately finds it emotionally resonant.

Output: user
Let's break down the review to understand its emotional content:

1. "like an afterschool special" - This comparison suggests that the film might be simplistic or overly moralistic, which is generally not a positive connotation.
2. "with costumes by gianni versace" - This part is positive, indicating that the film has high-quality, visually appealing costumes.
3. "mad love looks better than it feels" - This suggests that while the film may look good visually, the emotional or narrative content does not resonate as well.

Overall, the review seems to be pointing out a discrepancy between the film's visual appeal and its emotional or narrative quality. The tone is somewhat critical, but not harshly so. It acknowledges the film's aesthetic strengths while expressing disappointment in its emotional impact.

Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the review is more on the negative side, but not extremely so. Therefore, the classification would be:

Output: user
Let's break down the review to understand its emotional content:

1. The phrase "raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum" suggests that the film is considered better than typical children's fantasy, which is a positive comparison.
2. "Allen's astringent wit" implies that the humor in the film is sharp and biting, which is generally seen as a positive attribute, especially for those who appreciate this type of humor.

The overall tone of the review is appreciative of the film's quality and humor, indicating a positive sentiment. However, it is not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, which would be required for a "very positive" classification.

Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the review is positive.

Input: like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels .
Output: user
Let's break down the review to understand its emotional content:

1. "like an afterschool special" - This comparison suggests that the film might be simplistic or overly moralistic, which is generally not a positive connotation.
2. "with costumes by gianni versace" - This part is positive, indicating that the film has high-quality, visually appealing costumes.
3. "mad love looks better than it feels" - This suggests that while the film may look good visually, the emotional or narrative content does not resonate as well.

Overall, the review seems to be pointing out a discrepancy between the film's visual appeal and its emotional or narrative quality. The tone is somewhat critical, but not harshly so. It acknowledges the film's aesthetic strengths while expressing disappointment in its emotional impact.

Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the review is more on the negative side, but not extremely so. Therefore, the classification would be:

Output: user
To determine the sentiment of this movie review, let's break down the key points:

1. The review mentions "improbable melodrama" and "subtly kinky bedside vigils," which might suggest a somewhat unconventional or unusual approach to storytelling. This could be seen as a mixed sentiment, as it's not entirely positive or negative.

2. The phrase "sensational denouements" indicates that the ending of the movie is impactful or exciting, which is generally a positive sentiment.

3. The reviewer states, "at the end, we are undeniably touched," which suggests that the movie had an emotional impact on the viewer. This is a positive sentiment, as it implies that the movie successfully connected with the audience on an emotional level.

Considering these points, the overall sentiment of the review seems to lean towards a positive direction, despite the unconventional elements mentioned. The reviewer acknowledges the movie's unique aspects but ultimately finds it emotionally resonant.

The review describes the movie as a "close-to-solid espionage thriller," which suggests a generally positive view of the film's quality. However, the phrase "with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late" indicates a negative aspect related to its timing and possibly its relevance or uniqueness in the current market. Considering these elements, the overall sentiment seems to lean more towards a neutral to slightly negative tone due to the timing issue overshadowing the positive quality assessment.

The description of the performances as "odd and pixilated and sometimes both" could be seen as either positive or negative depending on the context, but given the overall tone of the review, it seems to be赞赏这些表演的独特性。因此，评论的整体情感倾向是积极的。请根据需要调整最后一句话以符合具体语境。由于最初指示为英文，我将保持最后一句的英文不变：\n\nThus, the overall sentiment of the review leans positive.\n\nInput: a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: observant intelligence constantly vies with pretension -- and sometimes plain wacky implausibility -- throughout maelstrom .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Analyze the provided movie review and ascertain which of the following emotional tones it best matches: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

"the story passes time" - This phrase suggests that the story is somewhat slow or uneventful, which can be seen as a negative point.\n2. "until it\'s time for an absurd finale" - The use of "absurd" implies that the finale is unrealistic or ridiculous, which is generally not a positive attribute for a movie.\n3. "twisted metal, fireballs and revenge" - While these elements might be exciting for some viewers, the context of "absurd" suggests that these elements are not presented in a way that the reviewer appreciates.\n\nOverall, the review does not contain any explicitly positive comments about the movie. The tone seems to be more on the negative side, criticizing the pacing and the absurdity of the finale. However, it is not extremely negative, as it does not use harsh language or express strong dislike.\n\nBased on this analysis, the sentiment of the review is best categorized as negative.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: an undeniably moving film to experience , and ultimately that \'s what makes it worth a recommendation .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: this film is not a love letter for the slain rappers , it \'s a taunt - a call for justice for two crimes from which many of us have not yet recovered .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: -lrb- barry -rrb- gives assassin a disquieting authority .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a sloppy , amusing comedy that proceeds from a stunningly unoriginal premise .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the script is smart , not cloying .\nOutput: user\nTo analyze the sentiment of the movie review "the script is smart, not cloying," let\'s break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Key Words and Phrases:**\n   - "smart": This word generally has a positive connotation, suggesting intelligence and cleverness.\n   - "not cloying": This phrase indicates that the script is not overly sweet or sentimental, which is also seen as a positive trait.\n\n2. **Evaluate Overall Tone:**\n   - The review highlights positive attributes of the script without any negative criticisms.\n   - The use of "smart" and "not cloying" both contribute to a favorable impression.\n\n3. **Determine Sentiment Category:**\n   - Given the positive nature of the words used and the absence of any negative elements, the review leans towards a positive sentiment.\n   - However, it does not contain extremely enthusiastic or effusive language that would classify it as "very positive."\n\nBased on this analysis, the sentiment of the review is best categorized as positive.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: leave it to the french to truly capture the terrifying angst of the modern working man without turning the film into a cheap thriller , a dumb comedy or a sappy melodrama .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story \'s emotional thrust .\nOutput: user\nThe review mentions "episodic choppiness" and "undermining the story\'s emotional thrust," which indicates dissatisfaction with the film\'s structure and emotional impact.

While "impeccable" is generally positive, indicating something is perfect or flawless, "perversity" has a negative connotation, suggesting something twisted or deviant. However, in the context of a movie review, describing a film as an impeccable study in perversity could imply that the film successfully captures or portrays its intended dark or twisted theme with great precision and skill. This could be seen as a form of praise for the film\'s execution, despite the subject matter being negative.\n\nGiven this analysis, the sentiment leans more towards a positive appreciation of the film\'s quality and execution, even if the subject matter is dark.

🧟Generated 4 mutated prompts.
😶Generated Prompts: ['Analyze the sentiment expressed in the given movie review and assign it to one of the five sentiment categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. After thoroughly examining the review, identify which category most accurately reflects its overall tone. Once you have determined the sentiment category that best suits the review, please provide your conclusion enclosed within <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .\nOutput: user\nThe review "you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain" suggests a very negative sentiment. The phrase implies that the movie is so unenjoyable that the viewer wishes it would end quickly, much like a desert yearns for rain. This metaphor conveys a strong sense of dissatisfaction and boredom, which aligns with a very negative sentiment.\n\n<final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: ... the movie feels stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies .\nOutput: user\nThe review suggests a negative sentiment due to the criticism that the movie feels "stitched together from stock situations and characters from other movies." This implies a lack of originality and creativity, which are generally not positive attributes for a film. Therefore, the sentiment is negative.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels .\nOutput: user\nThe review suggests a mixed sentiment but leans more towards a negative tone. The phrase "looks better than it feels" implies that while the visual aspects (costumes by Gianni Versace) might be appealing, the overall experience or content of the movie is not particularly satisfying or enjoyable. Comparing it to an "afterschool special" also suggests that the movie might be simplistic or overly moralistic, which is generally not seen as a positive attribute for a film.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .\nOutput: user\nTo analyze the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. "remarkably engaging" - This phrase suggests a positive sentiment, indicating that the movie is captivating and interesting.\n2. "despite being noticeably derivative" - This part introduces a negative aspect, suggesting that the movie borrows heavily from other films, which is generally seen as a drawback.\n3. "goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks" - This further emphasizes the derivative nature of the movie, reinforcing the negative sentiment.\n\nConsidering these points, the review acknowledges both positive and negative aspects of the movie. The positive sentiment comes from the movie being engaging, while the negative sentiment stems from its derivative nature. However, the positive aspect seems to outweigh the negative one, as the review starts with a strong positive statement and the negative aspects are presented as secondary.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration .\nOutput: user\nTo analyze the sentiment of the given movie review, let\'s break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Identify Key Phrases and Tone:**\n   - "completely spooky piece of business": This phrase suggests that the movie is very scary or unsettling, which can be seen as a positive sentiment for a horror or thriller movie.\n   - "gets under your skin": This indicates that the movie is effective in creating a lasting impression, which is generally a positive attribute.\n   - "stays there for the duration": This suggests that the movie maintains its impact throughout, which is also a positive sentiment.\n   - "some plot blips aside": This phrase acknowledges minor flaws in the plot, which slightly detracts from the overall positive sentiment but does not negate it entirely.\n\n2. **Overall Sentiment Analysis:**\n   - The review predominantly focuses on the movie\'s ability to create a spooky and lasting impression, which are positive attributes.\n   - The mention of "some plot blips" introduces a slight negative element, but it is not strong enough to shift the overall sentiment to a negative category.\n\n3. **Sentiment Category Assignment:**\n   - Given the positive aspects highlighted and the minor negative aspect, the review leans more towards a positive sentiment\n\nInput: in fact , it \'s quite fun in places .\nOutput: user\nBased on the given review "in fact, it\'s quite fun in places," the sentiment seems to be positive. The use of the word "fun" indicates an enjoyable experience, and although it\'s qualified by "in places," which suggests that not every part of the movie was enjoyable, the overall tone is still more positive than negative.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: an awfully good , achingly human picture .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: ... a delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet .\nOutput: user\nThe review describes the movie as a "delicious crime drama on par with the slickest of mamet." This indicates a very positive sentiment, as the reviewer is comparing the film favorably to works by David Mamet, a highly respected playwright and screenwriter known for his sharp dialogue and crime dramas. The use of the word "delicious" also suggests that the reviewer found the film highly enjoyable and satisfying.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Analyze the sentiment expressed in the provided movie review and assign it to one of the five emotional categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. Once you\'ve assessed the sentiment in this movie review, decide which of these five categories it fits into best and share your conclusion, enclosed within <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there \'s no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises \' are really surprising .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: dreary tale of middle-class angst\nOutput: user\nThe phrase "" suggests a negative sentiment. The word "dreary" implies a depressing or gloomy atmosphere, which is not a positive description of a movie. Therefore, the sentiment expressed in this review is negative.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: the vistas are sweeping and the acting is far from painful .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: wallace directs with such patronising reverence , it turns the stomach .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: an impeccable study in perversity .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both .\nOutput: user\nThe review mentions the movie as "very amusing" and notes that it takes "not the usual route in a thriller," which suggests a positive sentiment. The description of the performances as "odd and pixilated and sometimes both" could be seen as either positive or negative depending on the context, but in the context of a thriller taking an unusual route, it seems to align with the positive sentiment of the review. \n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the emotional tone of the provided movie review or critique and categorize it into one of these five sentiment groups: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. Once you\'ve determined the sentiment of the movie review, please present your final sentiment analysis of the review, enclosed within <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: i \'m left slightly disappointed that it did n\'t .\nOutput: user\nBased on the provided text "", the sentiment seems to lean towards a negative tone, as the reviewer expresses disappointment, albeit in a mild form with the use of "slightly."\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: rosenthal -lrb- halloween ii -rrb- seems to have forgotten everything he ever knew about generating suspense .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito \'s way .\nOutput: user\nBased on the provided text, the sentiment seems to be negative. The phrase "low-budget" often carries a negative connotation, suggesting that the movie lacks quality or polish. Comparing it to well-known films like "Scarface" or "Carlito\'s Way" but describing it as a "low-budget hybrid" implies that it fails to live up to the standards set by those films.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: provides a very moving and revelatory footnote to the holocaust .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: like its script , which nurses plot holes gaping enough to pilot an entire olympic swim team through , the characters in swimfan seem motivated by nothing short of dull , brain-deadening hangover .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: if horses could fly , this is surely what they \'d look like .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: making such a tragedy the backdrop to a love story risks trivializing it , though chouraqui no doubt intended the film to affirm love \'s power to help people endure almost unimaginable horror .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "After thoroughly examining the movie review provided, assess its emotional tone and assign it to one of the five defined sentiment categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

After thoroughly analyzing the movie review, select the most fitting sentiment category and enclose it within <final_answer> and </final_answer>.\n\nInput: paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .\nOutput: user\nThe review acknowledges that "Paid in Full" is engaging, which is a positive aspect, but it also points out that the movie is derivative of other films, which could be seen as a negative. However, the overall tone seems to lean more towards a positive sentiment, as the engagement factor seems to outweigh the criticism of it being derivative.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Analyze the sentiment expressed in the provided movie review and assign it to one of the five emotional categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

The elongation of the word "bad" emphasizes the reviewer\'s dissatisfaction or dislike. \n\n<final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: with very little to add beyond the dark visions already relayed by superb recent predecessors like swimming with sharks and the player , this latest skewering ... may put off insiders and outsiders alike .\nOutput: user\nThe review expresses a sentiment that is not particularly favorable towards the movie. It suggests that the movie does not offer much new content and may disappoint both those familiar with the subject matter and those who are not. This indicates a negative sentiment.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration .\nOutput: user\nThe review describes the movie as "completely spooky" and mentions that it "gets under your skin," which indicates a strong emotional impact. The phrase "stays there for the duration" suggests that the movie maintains its effect throughout, which is generally seen as a positive attribute for a film aiming to be spooky or engaging. The only slightly negative aspect mentioned is "some plot blips aside," but this minor criticism does not overshadow the overall positive sentiment towards the movie\'s ability to engage and affect the viewer.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: this bracingly truthful antidote to hollywood teenage movies that slather clearasil over the blemishes of youth captures the combustible mixture of a chafing inner loneliness and desperate grandiosity that tend to characterize puberty .\nOutput: user\nThe review expresses a nuanced and sophisticated appreciation for the movie\'s honest portrayal of teenage life, contrasting it favorably against more idealized Hollywood productions. The use of words like "bracingly truthful" and "captures the combustible mixture" suggests a strong positive sentiment towards the film\'s realistic approach to its subject matter. Therefore, the sentiment is decidedly positive.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: sometimes makes less sense than the bruckheimeresque american action flicks it emulates .\nOutput: user\nThe review suggests a critical stance towards the movie, indicating that it fails to meet the standards set by the action flicks it tries to emulate, and even makes less sense. This conveys a sentiment of disappointment and criticism, which aligns with a negative emotional category.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .\nOutput: user\nThe review acknowledges some flaws ("shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places") but also highlights positive aspects ("quietly moving moments" and "intelligent subtlety"). This suggests a generally favorable but not enthusiastically positive sentiment. \n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Assess the sentiment of the given movie review and identify which of these five emotional categories it best fits into: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

The tone implies that the reviewer finds the music intrusive or unnecessary in the context of the movie, preferring to experience it separately if at all. This indicates dissatisfaction with an aspect of the film, leading to a negative overall impression.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done .\nOutput: user\nThe review "this seductive tease of a thriller gets the job done" suggests a mildly positive sentiment. The use of "seductive tease" implies intrigue and engagement, while "gets the job done" indicates that the movie successfully fulfills its purpose, albeit in a straightforward manner. There isn\'t enough strongly positive or negative language to classify it as very positive or negative, so it leans more towards a positive sentiment but not overwhelmingly so.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: yet another entry in the sentimental oh-those-wacky-brits genre that was ushered in by the full monty and is still straining to produce another smash hit .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito \'s way .\nOutput: user\nThe review suggests a comparison to well-known films but with a negative connotation due to the "low-budget" descriptor, which typically implies lower quality or less polished production values. This indicates a sentiment that is not positive.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Output: user
To assess the emotional tone of the provided movie review, let's break down the key phrases and their implications:

1. "improbable melodrama" - This suggests that the movie has elements that might be seen as unrealistic or over-the-top, which could be viewed negatively.
2. "subtly kinky bedside vigils" - This indicates that there are intimate or emotionally charged scenes that are handled with subtlety, which can be seen as a positive aspect.
3. "sensational denouements" - This implies that the movie has exciting or dramatic endings, which is generally seen as a positive feature.
4. "undeniably touched" - This phrase suggests that despite the mixed elements, the overall effect on the viewer is emotionally impactful, which is a positive sentiment.

Considering these points, the review acknowledges some potentially negative aspects but ultimately concludes with a positive emotional impact. Therefore, the sentiment expressed in the review is positive.

<final_answer>positive</final_answer>

<final_answer>very negative</final_answer>

Input: it 's a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .
Output: user
The review acknowledges some flaws ("shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places") but also highlights positive aspects ("quietly moving moments" and "intelligent subtlety"). This suggests a generally favorable but not enthusiastically positive sentiment. 

<final_answer>positive</final_answer>

Input: a close-to-solid espionage thriller with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late .
Output: user
The review describes the movie as a "close-to-solid espionage thriller," which suggests a generally positive view of the film's quality. However, the phrase "with the misfortune of being released a few decades too late" indicates a negative aspect related to its timing and possibly its relevance or uniqueness in the current market. Considering these elements, the overall sentiment seems to lean more towards a neutral to slightly negative tone due to the timing issue overshadowing the positive quality assessment.

<final_answer>neutral</final_answer>

Input: shot largely in small rooms , the film has a gentle , unforced intimacy that never becomes claustrophobic .
Output: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>

What sentiment category does this movie review best fit into? Please wrap your conclusive assessment between <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: never lets go your emotions , taking them to surprising highs , sorrowful lows and hidden impulsive niches ... gorgeous , passionate , and at times uncommonly moving .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: for all its brilliant touches , dragon loses its fire midway , nearly flickering out by its perfunctory conclusion .\nOutput: user\nThe review starts by acknowledging some positive aspects ("brilliant touches") but then points out significant drawbacks, indicating a decline in quality ("loses its fire midway", "nearly flickering out", "perfunctory conclusion"). This suggests an overall disappointment, which aligns more with a negative sentiment than a positive one, but it\'s not entirely devoid of positive elements.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Examine the sentiment conveyed in the given movie review and classify it into one of the five emotional categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

The use of the word "delicious" suggests a high level of enjoyment and the comparison to "the slickest of mamet" (referring to the works of playwright David Mamet, known for his sharp and stylish dialogue) implies a high quality of writing and production.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: `` frailty \'\' starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different -lrb- and better -rrb- than most films with this theme .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: there are n\'t many conclusive answers in the film , but there is an interesting story of pointed personalities , courage , tragedy and the little guys vs. the big guys .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a lovely and beautifully photographed romance .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: only in its final surprising shots does rabbit-proof fence find the authority it \'s looking for .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: there \'s an admirable rigor to jimmy \'s relentless anger , and to the script \'s refusal of a happy ending , but as those monologues stretch on and on , you realize there \'s no place for this story to go but down .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: in the wrong hands , i.e. peploe \'s , it \'s simply unbearable\nOutput: user\nBased on the provided review, the sentiment is clearly negative.

Which sentiment best describes this movie review? Please encapsulate your final determination between <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: instead of panoramic sweep , kapur gives us episodic choppiness , undermining the story \'s emotional thrust .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: less a study in madness or love than a study in schoolgirl obsession .\nOutput: user\nThe review suggests a critical view of the movie, indicating that it fails to deliver a profound exploration of madness or love, instead focusing on a less mature theme of schoolgirl obsession. This implies disappointment and a somewhat negative sentiment towards the film\'s depth and thematic execution.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: this is christmas future for a lot of baby boomers .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: extremely well acted by the four primary actors , this is a seriously intended movie that is not easily forgotten .\nOutput: user\nBased on the review provided, the sentiment expressed is very positive.

The review also indicates that the movie offers something different, which is presented as a positive aspect for those seeking a unique experience.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .\nOutput: user\nThe review acknowledges some flaws ("shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places") but also highlights positive aspects ("quietly moving moments" and "intelligent subtlety"). This suggests a generally positive sentiment, albeit with some reservations. \n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the result , however well-intentioned , is ironically just the sort of disposable , kitchen-sink homage that illustrates why the whole is so often less than the sum of its parts in today \'s hollywood .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: suffice to say its total promise is left slightly unfulfilled .\nOutput: user\nThe review indicates a sense of disappointment as the movie\'s potential ("total promise") was not fully realized ("left slightly unfulfilled"). This suggests a sentiment that leans towards the negative side but is not extremely critical. Therefore, the sentiment can be categorized as negative.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

😶Generated Prompts: ['Evaluate the emotional tone of the given movie review and assign it to one of the following five sentiment categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. Once you have carefully analyzed the movie review, choose the sentiment category that best captures the review\'s emotional tone and place it between <final_answer> and </final_answer>. Can you determine the sentiment conveyed in this movie review?\n\nInput: spielberg \'s picture is smarter and subtler than -lrb- total recall and blade runner -rrb- , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences .\nOutput: user\nTo evaluate the emotional tone of this movie review, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. "Spielberg\'s picture is smarter and subtler" - This part of the review suggests a positive sentiment, as it praises the film for being intelligent and nuanced.\n2. "although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences" - This part introduces a slight negative sentiment, as it suggests that the plot might be too complex for some viewers, potentially limiting its appeal.\n\nConsidering these points, the review acknowledges the film\'s intelligence and subtlety but also points out a potential drawback. The overall tone is not overwhelmingly positive or negative, but rather balanced with a slight lean towards the positive side due to the praise for the film\'s qualities.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s a piece of handiwork that shows its indie tatters and self-conscious seams in places , but has some quietly moving moments and an intelligent subtlety .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a rip-roaring comedy action fest that \'ll put hairs on your chest .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a completely spooky piece of business that gets under your skin and , some plot blips aside , stays there for the duration .\nOutput: userHeaderCodeHeaderCodeuser\nThe review describes the movie as "completely spooky" and mentions that it "gets under your skin," which suggests a strong emotional impact. The phrase "stays there for the duration" implies that the movie maintains its effect throughout, which is generally seen as a positive attribute for a film aiming to be spooky or engaging. The only slightly negative element is "some plot blips aside," but this minor criticism does not overshadow the overall positive tone.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Examine the sentiment expressed in the provided movie review and categorize it into one of these five emotional levels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. After a detailed analysis of the review\'s emotional tone, select the category that most accurately reflects its overall sentiment. Please encapsulate your conclusive response between the <final_answer> and </final_answer> markers.\n\nInput: `` frailty \'\' starts out like a typical bible killer story , but it turns out to be significantly different -lrb- and better -rrb- than most films with this theme .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the story passes time until it \'s time for an absurd finale of twisted metal , fireballs and revenge .\nOutput: user\nBased on the provided movie review, the sentiment expressed seems to be negative. The use of words like "absurd" and "twisted" to describe the finale suggests a lack of appreciation or enjoyment of the film\'s ending. The overall tone does not convey any strong positive emotions, and the description of the story as merely "passing time" until the finale implies a lack of engagement or interest in the plot development.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: a creepy , intermittently powerful study of a self-destructive man ... about as unsettling to watch as an exploratory medical procedure or an autopsy .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a direct-to-void release , heading nowhere .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: -lrb- rises -rrb- above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: as a director , eastwood is off his game -- there \'s no real sense of suspense , and none of the plot ` surprises \' are really surprising .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: some of the most inventive silliness you are likely to witness in a movie theatre for some time .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Analyze the emotional undertones of the provided movie review and categorize it into one of these five sentiment groups: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. After a thorough evaluation of the review, select the sentiment that most accurately reflects its overall mood. What sentiment best encapsulates this movie review? Please wrap your conclusive assessment between <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell .\nOutput: user\nTo analyze the emotional undertones of the provided movie review, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. "predictable storyline and by-the-book scripting" - This part of the review suggests disappointment or dissatisfaction with the plot and writing, which could be seen as negative.\n2. "is all but washed away by sumptuous ocean visuals and the cinematic stylings of director john stockwell" - This part indicates that despite the negative aspects mentioned earlier, the movie is saved by its visuals and the director\'s style, which is a positive sentiment.\n\nThe review starts with a negative tone but shifts to a more positive one, suggesting that the positive aspects outweigh the negative ones. However, it\'s not overwhelmingly positive, as it still acknowledges the flaws in the storyline and scripting.\n\nConsidering these points, the overall sentiment of the review leans more towards a positive direction, but it\'s not extremely positive due to the initial criticism. Therefore, the most fitting sentiment category is "positive."\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: spectacularly beautiful , not to mention mysterious , sensual , emotionally intense , and replete with virtuoso throat-singing .\nOutput: user\nThe review uses words like "spectacularly beautiful," "mysterious," "sensual," "emotionally intense," and "virtuoso," which all carry very positive connotations. There are no negative or neutral terms that would suggest anything other than a very positive sentiment towards the movie.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: he watches them as they float within the seas of their personalities .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid of scarface or carlito \'s way .\nOutput: user\nBased on the provided movie review, the phrase "looks and feels like a low-budget hybrid" suggests a comparison that isn\'t necessarily positive, especially when referring to the budget as "low." This comparison to well-known films like "Scarface" or "Carlito\'s Way" might imply a lack of originality or quality. Therefore, the sentiment seems to lean towards a negative impression.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: if ever such a dependable concept was botched in execution , this is it .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: twenty years after its first release , e.t. remains the most wondrous of all hollywood fantasies -- and the apex of steven spielberg \'s misunderstood career .\nOutput: user\nBased on the provided movie review, the sentiment is overwhelmingly positive. The use of words like "wondrous" and referring to the film as the "apex" of Spielberg\'s career indicates a high level of praise and admiration. \n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: as an actress , madonna is one helluva singer .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: spielberg \'s picture is smarter and subtler than -lrb- total recall and blade runner -rrb- , although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences .\nOutput: user\nTo analyze the emotional undertones of the provided movie review, let\'s break it down:\n\n1. "Spielberg\'s picture is smarter and subtler" - This part of the review suggests a positive sentiment, as it praises the film for being intelligent and nuanced.\n2. "although its plot may prove too convoluted for fun-seeking summer audiences" - This part introduces a slight negative sentiment, as it suggests that the complexity of the plot might not appeal to all viewers, particularly those looking for a light, entertaining summer movie.\n\nThe review acknowledges the film\'s intelligence and subtlety, which are positive attributes, but it also points out a potential drawback regarding its accessibility to a broad audience. The overall tone is not overwhelmingly positive or negative; it\'s more balanced and slightly leans towards a positive sentiment due to the praise for the film\'s quality.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Analyze the emotional tone of the given movie review and assign it to one of the five sentiment categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

This implies a critical stance, indicating disappointment and a lack of appreciation for the film\'s quality or originality. Therefore, the sentiment is negative.\n\n<final_answer>Negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: engages us in constant fits of laughter , until we find ourselves surprised at how much we care about the story , and end up walking out not only satisfied but also somewhat touched .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain .\nOutput: user\nThe phrase "you begin to long for the end credits as the desert does for rain" suggests a strong sense of dissatisfaction and impatience, implying that the movie is so unenjoyable that the viewer wishes it would end quickly, much like a desert yearns for a rare rain.

What is the primary sentiment of this review? Please wrap your conclusive assessment between <final_answer> and </final_answer> markers.\n\nInput: ... a lesson in prehistoric hilarity .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: the film does give a pretty good overall picture of the situation in laramie following the murder of matthew shepard .\nOutput: user\nTo determine the sentiment of the provided movie review, let\'s break down the key elements:\n\n1. The phrase "does give a pretty good overall picture" suggests a positive evaluation of the film\'s portrayal of the situation.\n2. The review does not contain any explicitly negative or critical comments about the film.\n3. The sentiment is not overly enthusiastic or filled with praise, which would indicate a very positive sentiment.\n\nBased on these observations, the sentiment leans towards a positive but not overly enthusiastic tone. Therefore, the primary sentiment of this review can be categorized as positive.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .\nOutput: user\nThe review seems to criticize the movie for not avoiding cliches and describes its treatment of gang warfare as "perfervid," which means intense or passionate to the point of being excessive. This suggests a negative tone towards the film\'s execution and content. \n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: dreary tale of middle-class angst\nOutput: user\nBased on the phrase "," the sentiment seems to be negative. The word "dreary" suggests a depressing or gloomy atmosphere, which is not a positive description of a movie. There\'s no indication of any positive aspects in this short review. \n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: they \'re just a couple of cops in copmovieland , these two , but in narc , they find new routes through a familiar neighborhood .\nOutput: user\nThe review seems to convey a sentiment that acknowledges the familiarity of the genre but appreciates the new elements or approaches introduced in the movie.

"not even solondz\'s thirst for controversy" - This suggests that the director\'s usual approach to creating controversy is not effective here.\n2. "sketchy characters and immature provocations" - These are negative descriptors, indicating that the characters and provocations are not well-developed or sophisticated.\n3. "can fully succeed at cheapening it" - This implies that the director\'s usual methods might cheapen the movie, but they do not fully succeed in doing so.\n\nThe review acknowledges some negative aspects of the movie but also suggests that these elements do not entirely succeed in diminishing the film\'s quality. The overall tone is more on the negative side but not extremely so.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: the biggest problem i have -lrb- other than the very sluggish pace -rrb- is we never really see her esther blossom as an actress , even though her talent is supposed to be growing .\nOutput: user\nThe review expresses dissatisfaction with the movie\'s pacing and the character development of Esther.

After evaluating the sentiment of this movie review, choose the category that best matches its overall tone and provide your conclusion. What sentiment level does this movie review best align with? Please wrap your final decision with <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags.\n\nInput: no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .\nOutput: user\nThe review mentions that "no cliche escapes" the movie, which suggests that the film relies heavily on overused and unoriginal elements. The term "perfervid" implies intense or passionate to an excessive degree, which in this context seems to be used critically. The overall tone is critical and disappointed, indicating a negative sentiment towards the movie.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: it \'s a treat watching shaw , a british stage icon , melting under the heat of phocion \'s attentions .\nOutput: user\nThe review expresses a positive sentiment towards the performance of the actor, describing it as a "treat" to watch. This indicates an appreciation and enjoyment of the movie, specifically the acting. Therefore, the sentiment level of this review is positive.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: little more than a well-mounted history lesson .\nOutput: user\nThe phrase "little more than a well-mounted history lesson" suggests that the movie is informative but lacks engaging or emotional qualities that would make it stand out. This indicates a somewhat underwhelming experience, which aligns more with a negative sentiment rather than a positive one, as the reviewer seems to imply that the film is not much beyond an educational tool and does not provide additional value such as entertainment or emotional engagement.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Analyze the emotional tone of the given movie review and categorize it into one of these five sentiment levels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

Can you determine the sentiment of this movie review?\n\nInput: very amusing , not the usual route in a thriller , and the performances are odd and pixilated and sometimes both .\nOutput: user Reasoning: The review mentions the movie as "very amusing" and "not the usual route in a thriller," which suggests a positive sentiment. However, the description of the performances as "odd and pixilated" could be seen as a criticism, but it\'s not necessarily negative, as it could be interpreted as unique or unconventional. Overall, the tone seems to lean more towards a positive sentiment, appreciating the movie\'s uniqueness and entertainment value.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: gorgeous scenes , masterful performances , but the sickly sweet gender normative narrative left an acrid test in this gourmet \'s mouth .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: adrift , bentley and hudson stare and sniffle , respectively , as ledger attempts , in vain , to prove that movie-star intensity can overcome bad hair design .\nOutput: user\nThe review seems to be criticizing the movie, pointing out negative aspects such as the actors\' performances and the poor hair design. The use of words like "sniffle" and "in vain" suggests disappointment and dissatisfaction. Therefore, the sentiment of this review can be categorized as negative.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Examine the sentiment expressed in the provided movie review and categorize it into one of these five emotional levels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

"succeeds primarily with her typical blend of unsettling atmospherics" - This suggests that the director\'s style is effective, but the atmosphere is unsettling, which can be seen as a mixed sentiment. However, the use of "succeeds" leans towards a positive sentiment.\n\n2. "delivering a series of abrasive, stylized sequences" - The term "abrasive" has a negative connotation, but "stylized" suggests a deliberate artistic choice, which can be seen as positive in the context of artistic expression.\n\n3. "that burn themselves upon the viewer\'s memory" - This implies that the sequences are memorable, which is generally a positive attribute for a film.\n\nConsidering these points, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards a positive evaluation, acknowledging the film\'s effectiveness in creating a memorable and distinctive viewing experience, despite the unsettling and abrasive elements.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: the movie spends more time with schneider than with newcomer mcadams , even though her performance is more interesting -lrb- and funnier -rrb- than his .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:']

Output: user
The review mentions that "no cliche escapes" the movie, which suggests that the film relies heavily on overused and unoriginal elements.

The phrase "raised a few notches above" suggests an improvement or elevation, which is a positive sentiment. "Astringent wit" implies a sharp, biting humor, which can be seen as a positive attribute for a film, especially if it's meant to be witty and clever.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: The review is comparing this version to the original and suggesting that it has been improved by the addition of Allen's wit. This indicates that the reviewer sees the film as better than a simple "kiddie fantasy," which is a positive assessment.

3. **Overall Sentiment**: The review is not overly enthusiastic, but it does convey a positive sentiment. The reviewer appreciates the film's wit and sees it as an improvement over a basic fantasy film.

Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the review is positive.

Please wrap your final decision with <final_answer> and </final_answer> tags.

Input: no cliche escapes the perfervid treatment of gang warfare called ces wild .
Output: user
The review mentions that "no cliche escapes" the movie, which suggests that the film relies heavily on overused and unoriginal elements. The term "perfervid" implies intense or passionate to an excessive degree, which in this context seems to be used critically. The overall tone is critical and disappointed, indicating a negative sentiment towards the movie.

<final_answer>negative</final_answer>

<final_answer>positive</final_answer>

Input: little more than a well-mounted history lesson .
Output: user
The phrase "little more than a well-mounted history lesson" suggests that the movie is informative but lacks engaging or emotional qualities that would make it stand out. This indicates a somewhat underwhelming experience, which aligns more with a negative sentiment rather than a positive one, as the reviewer seems to imply that the film is not much beyond an educational tool and does not provide additional value such as entertainment or emotional engagement.

Input: like the original , this version is raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum by allen 's astringent wit .
Output: user
To analyze the sentiment of the movie review, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Identify Key Phrases and Tone**: The review mentions "raised a few notches above kiddie fantasy pablum" and "Allen's astringent wit." The phrase "raised a few notches above" suggests an improvement or elevation, which is a positive sentiment. "Astringent wit" implies a sharp, biting humor, which can be seen as a positive attribute for a film, especially if it's meant to be witty and clever.

2. **Contextual Understanding**: The review is comparing this version to the original and suggesting that it has been improved by the addition of Allen's wit. This indicates that the reviewer sees the film as better than a simple "kiddie fantasy," which is a positive assessment.

3. **Overall Sentiment**: The review is not overly enthusiastic, but it does convey a positive sentiment. The reviewer appreciates the film's wit and sees it as an improvement over a basic fantasy film.

Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the review is positive.
