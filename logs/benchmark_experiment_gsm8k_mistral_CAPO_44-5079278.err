He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?\nOutput: To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of cutting the pizza and distributing the slices to Phil's friends. Let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Initial Cut**: Phil cuts the pizza in half.\n   - Number of slices: 2\n\n2. **Second Cut: Phil cuts both halves in half.\n   - Number of slices: 2 + 2 = 4\n\n3. **Third cut: Phil cuts each slice in half.\n   - Number of slices: 4 + 4 = 8\n\n4. **Distribution: Phil passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.\n   - Total slices given to friends: 3 * 1 + 2 * 2 = 3 + 4 = 7\n\n5. **Remaining slices: Subtract the distributed slices from the total number of slices.\n   - Remaining slices: 8 - 7 = 1\n\n<final_answer>1</final_answer>\n\nInput: Jimmy's father receives 20 emails a day. Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day to his email.

If he initially had 50 pants, calculate the number of pants he'll have in 5 years.\nOutput: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pants Dani will have after 5 years. Let's break down the steps:\n\n1. **Initial Number of Pants**: Dani starts with 50 pants.\n2. **Annual Increase**: Each year, Dani gets 4 pairs of two pants. Each pair consists of 2 pants, so each year he gets 4 pairs * 2 pants = 8 pants.\n3. **Total Increase over 5 years**: Over 5 years, the total increase in pants is 5 years * 8 pants = 40 pants.\n4. **Total number of pants after 5 years**: The total number of pants after 5 years is the initial number of pants plus the total increase.\n\nLet's calculate the total number of pants:\n\n- Initial number of pants: 50\n- Total increase over 5 years: 40\n- Total number of pants after 5 years: 50 + 40 = 90\n\n<final_answer>90</final_answer>\n\nInput: Sixteen boys and 14 girls attended Simon's birthday party.

Input: Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of each type of insect and then sum them up.

1. **Giant Roaches**: Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. **Scorpions**: Calvin has 3 scorpions.
3. **Crickets**: Calvin has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) crickets.
4. **Caterpillars**: Calvin has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) caterpillars.

Now, we sum up all the insects:
\[ 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

Input: Cheryl got angry with her sister and decided to run away from home. She walked 2 miles every hour for 3 hours. Then she got homesick and walked back home. How many miles did Cheryl walk in total?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Cheryl walked. We can break it down into two parts: the distance she walked away from home and the distance she walked back home.

1. **Distance away from home:**
   - Cheryl walked 2 miles every hour for 3 hours.
   - Total distance away from home = 2 miles/hour * 3 hours = 6 miles.

2. **Distance back home:**
   - Cheryl walked back the same distance she traveled away from home.
   - Total distance back home = 6 miles.

3. **Total distance walked:**
   - Total distance = distance away from home + distance back home = 6 miles + 6 miles = 12 miles.

Input: Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the variables**:
   Let \( c$ be the number of cucumbers.
   Let $t$ be the number of tomatoes.

2. **Set up the equations based on the problem:
   - The total number of vegetables is 280.
   - There are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers.

   Therefore, we have:
   \[ c + t = 280 \]
   \[ t = 3c \]

3. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
   \[ c + 3c = 280 \]
   \[ 4c = 280\]

4. **Solve for $c$:
   \[ c = \frac{280}{4} \]
    \[ c = 70\]

So, the number of cucumbers used in the salad is 70.

Input: Jane bought 2 skirts for $13 each. She also bought 3 blouses for $6 each. She paid the cashier $100. How much change did she receive?
Output: To solve this problem, we can break it into logical steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the skirts:**
   - Jane bought 2 skirts at $13 each.
   - Total cost for skirts = 2 * $13 = $26

2. **Calculate the total cost of the blouses:**
   - Jane bought 3 blouses at $6 each.
   - Total cost for blouses = 3 * $6 = $18

3. **Calculate the total cost of all items:**
   - Total cost = cost of skirts + cost of blouses
   - Total cost = $26 + $18 = $44

4. **Calculate the change Jane received:**
   - Jane paid $100.
   - Change = $100 - total cost
    - Change = $100 - $44 = $56

Input: James earns $10 per week as an allowance. After saving all his money for four weeks, he spends half of it on a new video game. He then spends a quarter of what is left to buy a new book. How much money does he have left?
Output: To solve this problem, we will break it into logical steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount James saves in four weeks:**
   - James earns $10 per week.
   - Total amount saved in four weeks = $10 * 4 = $40.

2. **Calculate the amount spent on the video game:**

   - Amount spent on the video game = $40 / 2 = $20.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after buying the video game:**
   - Remaining amount = $40 - $20 = $20.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on the book:**
   - James spends a quarter of the remaining amount on the book.
   - Amount spent on the book = $20 / 4 = $5.

5. **Calculate the final amount James has left:**
   - Final amount = $20 - $5 = $15.

Input: Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of paper cranes**: Alice wants 1000 paper cranines.
2. **Alice folds half of the paper cranines**: Alice folds half of 1000, which is:
   \[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]
3. **Remaining paper cranines**: After Alice folds 500, the remaining number of paper cranines is:
   \[ 1000 - 500 = 500 \]
4. **Friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranines**: The friend folds a fifth of 500, which is:
   \[ \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]
5. **Remaining paper cranines after the friend folds**: After the friend folds 100, the remaining number of paper cranines is:
   \[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranines.

Input: Lucia is a dancer. She takes 2 hip-hop classes a week, 2 ballet classes a week, and 1 jazz class a week. One hip-hop class costs $10. One ballet class costs $12, and one jazz class costs $8. What is the total cost of Lucia’s dance classes in one week?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost of Lucia's dance classes for one week. We will break down the costs for each type of dance class and then sum them up.

1. **Hip-hop classes:**
   - Lucia takes 2 hip-hop classes per week.
   - Each hip-hop class costs $10.
   - Total cost for hip-hop classes: \(2 \times 10 = 20$

2. **Ballet classes:**
   - Lucia takes 2 ballet classes per week.
   - Each ballet class costs $12.
   - Total cost for ballet classes: \(2 \times 12 = 24\)

3. **Jazz classes:**
   - Lucia takes 1 jazz class per week.
   - Each jazz class costs $8.
   - Total cost for jazz classes: \(1 \times 8 = 8$

Now, we sum up the costs for all types of dance classes:
\[20 + 24 + 8 = 52\]

Therefore, the total cost of Lucia's dance classes in one week is <final_answer>52</final_answer>.

Input: Uncle Ben has 440 chickens on his farm. 39 are roosters and the rest are hens. 15 of his hens do not lay eggs, and the rest do. If each egg-laying hen lays 3 eggs, how many eggs will Uncle Ben have?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of hens:**
   Uncle Ben has 440 chickens, and 39 of them are roosters. Therefore, the number of hens is:
   \[ 440 - 39 = 401 \]

2. **Determine the number of egg-laying hens:**
   Out of the 401 hens, 15 do not lay eggs. Therefore, the number of egg-laying hens is:
   \[ 401 - 15 = 386\]

3. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the egg-laying hens:**
   Each egg-laying hen lays 3 eggs. Therefore, the total number of eggs is:
   \[ 386 \times 3 = 1158\]

So, the total number of eggs Uncle Ben will have is <final_answer>1158</final_answer>.

Input: Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of paper cranes**: Alice wants 1000 paper cranines.
2. **Alice folds half of the paper cranines**: Alice folds half of 1000, which is:
   \[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]
3. **Remaining paper cranines**: After Alice folds 500, the remaining number of paper cranines is:
   \[ 1000 - 500 = 500 \]
4. **Friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranines**: The friend folds a fifth of 500, which is:
   \[ \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]
5. **Remaining paper cranines after the friend folds**: After the friend folds 100, the remaining number of paper cranines is:
   \[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranines.

Input: Kendra tracks the different species of birds they spot on their birdwatching trip. On Monday they visited 5 sites and saw an average of 7 birds at each site. On Tuesday, Kendra visited 5 sites and saw an average of 5 birds at each site. On Wednesday visited 10 sites and saw an average of 8 birds at each site. On average, how many different birds did Kendra see on each site?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the average number of birds Kendra saw on each site over the three days. Here is the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the total number of birds seen on each day:**
   - Monday: 5 sites with an average of 7 birds each.
     \[ 5 \times 7 = 35 \]
   - Tuesday: 5 sites with an average of 5 birds each.
    \[ 5 \times 5 = 25 \]
   - Wednesday: 10 sites with an average of 8 birds each.
    \[ 10 \times 8 = 80\]

2. **Calculate the total number of birds seen over the three days:**
    \[ 35 + 25 + 80 = 140\]

3. **Calculate the total number of sites visited over the three days:
    \[ 5 + 5 + 10 = 20\]

4. **Calculate the average number of birds seen per site:
    \[ \frac{140}{20} = 7 \]

Therefore, the average number of birds Kendra saw on each site is <final_answer>7</final_answer>.

Input: Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of each type of insect and then sum them up.

1. **Giant Roaches**: Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. **Scorpions**: Calvin has 3 scorpions.
3. **Crickets**: Calvin has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) crickets.
4. **Caterpillars**: Calvin has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) caterpillars.

Now, we sum up all the insects:
\[ 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

Input: Cheryl got angry with her sister and decided to run away from home. She walked 2 miles every hour for 3 hours. Then she got homesick and walked back home. How many miles did Cheryl walk in total?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Cheryl walked. We can break it down into two parts: the distance she walked away from home and the distance she walked back home.

1. **Distance away from home:**
   - Cheryl walked 2 miles every hour for 3 hours.
   - Total distance away from home = 2 miles/hour * 3 hours = 6 miles.

2. **Distance back home:**
   - Cheryl walked back the same distance she traveled away from home.
   - Total distance back home = 6 miles.

3. **Total distance walked:**
   - Total distance = distance away from home + distance back home = 6 miles + 6 miles = 12 miles.

Input: Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the variables**:
   Let \( c$ be the number of cucumbers.
   Let $t$ be the number of tomatoes.

2. **Set up the equations based on the problem:
   - The total number of vegetables is 280.
   - There are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers.

   Therefore, we have:
   \[ c + t = 280 \]
   \[ t = 3c \]

3. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
   \[ c + 3c = 280 \]
   \[ 4c = 280\]

4. **Solve for $c$:
   \[ c = \frac{280}{4} \]
    \[ c = 70\]

So, the number of cucumbers used in the salad is 70.

3. **Calculate the remaining amount after buying the video game:**
   - Remaining amount = $40 - $20 = $20.

4. **Calculate the amount spent on the book:**
   - James spends a quarter of the remaining amount on the book.
   - Amount spent on the book = $20 / 4 = $5.

5. **Calculate the final amount James has left:**
