Include your final classification within <final_answer> </final_answer>.\n\nInput: spend your benjamins on a matinee .\nOutput: user\nThe phrase "spend your benjamins on a matinee" suggests a somewhat neutral to slightly negative sentiment. The term "benjamins" is slang for money, and the suggestion to spend money on a matinee (an early show) might imply that the reviewer thinks the movie is not worth seeing at a regular price or time, but might be acceptable if it\'s cheaper or more convenient. However, without more context, it\'s hard to determine a strong sentiment. \n\n<final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: in a strange way , egoyan has done too much .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentiment of the given cinema review:\n\n1. **Identify Key Words and Phrases:**\n   - "multilayered" suggests complexity and depth, which is generally positive.\n   - "sympathetic" implies that the characters are relatable and evoke empathy, which is also positive.\n   - "characters of the year" suggests that these characters are among the best of the year, which is highly positive.\n\n2. **Overall Tone:**\n   - The review focuses on praising the characters for their depth and relatability.\n   - There are no negative or critical comments present.\n\n3. **Sentiment Analysis:**\n   - The review is clearly positive, as it highlights the strengths of the characters without any negative aspects.\n\nBased on the analysis, the sentiment of the review is very positive.\n\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it is n\'t .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentiment of the review:\n\n1. "an energetic and engaging film" - This part of the review is positive, as it describes the film as energetic and engaging, which are favorable qualities.\n2. "that never pretends to be something it isn\'t" - This part is also positive, as it suggests the film is honest and true to itself, which is generally seen as a positive attribute.\n\nThere are no negative or neutral elements in the review. The overall tone is positive.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: a charmer from belgium .\nOutput: user\nBased on the phrase "a charmer from Belgium," the sentiment seems to be positive, as "charmer" implies something or someone that is appealing or attractive. \n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: while the material is slight , the movie is better than you might think .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentiment of the review step by step:\n\n1. The phrase "the material is slight" suggests a minor criticism, indicating that the content or plot of the movie might be thin or not very substantial.\n2. However, the second part of the sentence, "the movie is better than you might think," is a positive statement. It implies that despite the initial expectation or the slight material, the overall quality of the movie exceeds expectations.\n\nConsidering these points, the review leans more towards a positive sentiment, as it suggests that the movie is better than anticipated, which is a favorable opinion.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: -lrb- rises -rrb- above its oh-so-hollywood rejiggering and its conventional direction to give the film a soul and an unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the sentiment of the review:\n\n1. The phrase "rises above" suggests a positive sentiment, as it implies the film overcomes certain limitations.\n2. "Oh-so-hollywood rejiggering" and "conventional direction" are somewhat negative, indicating that the film has some conventional or predictable elements.\n3. However, these negative aspects are outweighed by the positive outcomes: "gives the film a soul" and "unabashed sense of good old-fashioned escapism." These phrases suggest that despite its conventional elements, the film succeeds in being engaging and enjoyable.\n\nOverall, the review leans more towards a positive sentiment, as it acknowledges some conventional aspects but emphasizes the film\'s ability to rise above these and provide a soulful and entertaining experience.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: peter jackson and company once again dazzle and delight us , fulfilling practically every expectation either a longtime tolkien fan or a movie-going neophyte could want .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Quick sentiment check - is this movie review very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive?

"a solid cast" - This phrase suggests a positive tone, as it implies the actors performed well.\n2. "assured direction" - This indicates confidence in the director\'s work, which is also positive.\n3. "complete lack of modern day irony" - This could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. If the reviewer values sincerity over irony, this could be seen as a positive point. However, without more context, it\'s somewhat neutral.\n\nOverall, the critique seems to lean towards a positive tone, as it highlights good qualities of the cast and direction, and appreciates the absence of modern irony, which the reviewer seems to view favorably.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: cold , pretentious , thoroughly dislikable study in sociopathy .\nOutput: <final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: -lrb- taylor -rrb- takes us on a ride that \'s consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: elegantly produced and expressively performed , the six musical numbers crystallize key plot moments into minutely detailed wonders of dreamlike ecstasy .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: such a wildly uneven hit-and-miss enterprise , you ca n\'t help suspecting that it was improvised on a day-to-day basis during production .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput:', 'Given this movie critique, determine whether the overall sentiment is very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

The review starts with a somewhat neutral tone, acknowledging that the film "kicks off spookily enough," which suggests that the beginning of the film is at least engaging or intriguing.\n2. However, the reviewer then criticizes the film for taking "an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance." The use of "glucose sentimentality" implies that the film becomes overly sweet or emotionally manipulative, which is generally seen as a negative trait. The term "laughable contrivance" suggests that the plot or story elements are unrealistic or poorly constructed, which is also a negative assessment.\n\nGiven these points, the overall sentiment of the review is negative, as the criticism outweighs the initial neutral observation.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: decent but dull .\nOutput: user\nLet\'s analyze the emotional content of the review "decent but dull."\n\nThe word "decent" suggests that the film meets a basic standard of quality, which is not negative but also not particularly positive. It implies a neutral to slightly positive sentiment.\n\nHowever, the word "dull" carries a negative connotation, indicating that the film is uninteresting or boring.\n\nConsidering both words together, the review leans more towards a negative sentiment due to the use of "dull," but it is not strongly negative because "decent" softens the overall tone.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: a listless sci-fi comedy in which eddie murphy deploys two guises and elaborate futuristic sets to no particularly memorable effect .\nOutput: <final_answer>very negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: tsai has a well-deserved reputation as one of the cinema world \'s great visual stylists , and in this film , every shot enhances the excellent performances .\nOutput: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: delia , greta , and paula rank as three of the most multilayered and sympathetic female characters of the year .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: this filmed tosca -- not the first , by the way -- is a pretty good job , if it \'s filmed tosca that you want .\nOutput: user\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: i \'m not generally a fan of vegetables but this batch is pretty cute .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput:', "Assess the tone of the provided film review and categorize it as one of the following: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive.

Output: user

Input: a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony .
Output: user
Let's analyze the critique step by step:

1. "a solid cast" - This phrase suggests a positive tone, as it implies the actors performed well.
2. "assured direction" - This indicates confidence in the director's work, which is also positive.
3. "complete lack of modern day irony" - This could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. If the reviewer values sincerity over irony, this could be seen as a positive point. However, without more context, it's somewhat neutral.

Overall, the critique seems to lean towards a positive tone, as it highlights good qualities of the cast and direction, and appreciates the absence of modern irony, which the reviewer seems to view favorably.

Input: though tom shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
Output: user
Let's analyze the emotional content of the review:

1. The review starts with a somewhat neutral tone, acknowledging that the film "kicks off spookily enough," which suggests that the beginning of the film is at least engaging or intriguing.
2. However, the reviewer then criticizes the film for taking "an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance." The use of "glucose sentimentality" implies that the film becomes overly sweet or emotionally manipulative, which is generally seen as a negative trait. The term "laughable contrivance" suggests that the plot or story elements are unrealistic or poorly constructed, which is also a negative assessment.

Given these points, the overall sentiment of the review is negative, as the criticism outweighs the initial neutral observation.

<final_answer>negative</final_answer>

Input: decent but dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the emotional content of the review "decent but dull."

The word "decent" suggests that the film meets a basic standard of quality, which is not negative but also not particularly positive. It implies a neutral to slightly positive sentiment.

However, the word "dull" carries a negative connotation, indicating that the film is uninteresting or boring.

Considering both words together, the review leans more towards a negative sentiment due to the use of "dull," but it is not strongly negative because "decent" softens the overall tone.

Determine the emotional tone of the following movie critique. Is it very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive? Your classification must be provided between <final_answer> and </final_answer> markers.

Input: it 's affecting , amusing , sad and reflective .
Output: user
<final_answer>positive</final_answer>

Input: a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony .
Output: user
Let's analyze the critique step by step:

1. "a solid cast" - This phrase suggests a positive tone, as it implies the actors performed well.
2. "assured direction" - This indicates confidence in the director's work, which is also positive.
3. "complete lack of modern day irony" - This could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. If the reviewer values sincerity over irony, this could be seen as a positive point. However, without more context, it's somewhat neutral.

Overall, the critique seems to lean towards a positive tone, as it highlights good qualities of the cast and direction, and appreciates the absence of modern irony, which the reviewer seems to view favorably.

Evaluate the emotional content of the following film review and classify it into one of five sentiment categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. Your classification must be provided between <final_answer> and </final_answer> markers.

Input: though tom shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
Output: user
Let's analyze the emotional content of the review:

1. The review starts with a somewhat neutral tone, acknowledging that the film "kicks off spookily enough," which suggests that the beginning of the film is at least engaging or intriguing.
2. However, the reviewer then criticizes the film for taking "an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance." The use of "glucose sentimentality" implies that the film becomes overly sweet or emotionally manipulative, which is generally seen as a negative trait. The term "laughable contrivance" suggests that the plot or story elements are unrealistic or poorly constructed, which is also a negative assessment.

Given these points, the overall sentiment of the review is negative, as the criticism outweighs the initial neutral observation.

<final_answer>negative</final_answer>

Input: decent but dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the emotional content of the review "decent but dull."

The word "decent" suggests that the film meets a basic standard of quality, which is not negative but also not particularly positive. It implies a neutral to slightly positive sentiment.

However, the word "dull" carries a negative connotation, indicating that the film is uninteresting or boring.

Considering both words together, the review leans more towards a negative sentiment due to the use of "dull," but it is not strongly negative because "decent" softens the overall tone.

Output: user
<final_answer>positive</final_answer>

Input: though tom shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
Output: user
Let's analyze the emotional content of the review:

1. The review starts with a somewhat neutral tone, acknowledging that the film "kicks off spookily enough," which suggests that the beginning of the film is at least engaging or intriguing.
2. However, the reviewer then criticizes the film for taking "an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance." The use of "glucose sentimentality" implies that the film becomes overly sweet or emotionally manipulative, which is generally seen as a negative trait. The term "laughable contrivance" suggests that the plot or story elements are unrealistic or poorly constructed, which is also a negative assessment.

Given these points, the overall sentiment of the review is negative, as the criticism outweighs the initial neutral observation.

<final_answer>negative</final_answer>

Input: decent but dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the emotional content of the review "decent but dull."

The word "decent" suggests that the film meets a basic standard of quality, which is not negative but also not particularly positive. It implies a neutral to slightly positive sentiment.

However, the word "dull" carries a negative connotation, indicating that the film is uninteresting or boring.

Considering both words together, the review leans more towards a negative sentiment due to the use of "dull," but it is not strongly negative because "decent" softens the overall tone.

Input: a solid cast , assured direction and complete lack of modern day irony .
Output: user
Let's analyze the critique step by step:

1. "a solid cast" - This phrase suggests a positive tone, as it implies the actors performed well.
2. "assured direction" - This indicates confidence in the director's work, which is also positive.
3. "complete lack of modern day irony" - This could be interpreted in different ways depending on the context. If the reviewer values sincerity over irony, this could be seen as a positive point. However, without more context, it's somewhat neutral.

Overall, the critique seems to lean towards a positive tone, as it highlights good qualities of the cast and direction, and appreciates the absence of modern irony, which the reviewer seems to view favorably.

To assess the emotional tone of the provided movie review, let's break down the key phrases and their implications:

1. "an uncomfortable experience" - This suggests a negative sentiment, as discomfort is generally not a positive feeling.

😶Generated Prompts: ['Assess the emotional tone of the given movie review and assign it to one of the five defined sentiment categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. Following your analysis of the review\'s sentiment, identify which of these five levels most accurately reflects its general mood. Please finalize your evaluation by placing your chosen sentiment between the markers <final_answer>selected_sentiment</final_answer>.\n\nInput: it may be a no-brainer , but at least it \'s a funny no-brainer .\nOutput: user\nBased on the review "it may be a no-brainer , but at least it \'s a funny no-brainer.", the sentiment seems to be positive. The reviewer acknowledges that the movie might be simple or straightforward ("no-brainer"), but emphasizes that it is enjoyable and amusing. The use of "at least" suggests that the positive aspect (being funny) outweighs the negative aspect (being a no-brainer). Therefore, the overall tone is positive.\n\n<final_answer>positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: provides a porthole into that noble , trembling incoherence that defines us all .\nOutput: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>\n\nInput: overall , it \'s a very entertaining , thought-provoking film with a simple message : god is love .\nOutput: <final_answer>very positive</final_answer>\n\nInput: spare but quietly effective retelling .\nOutput: user\nThe review "spare but quietly effective retelling" suggests a tone that is generally positive, albeit with a reserved or understated quality. The use of "quietly effective" implies that the movie successfully achieves its goals in a subtle way, which is a compliment.

Input: -lrb- at least -rrb- moore is a real charmer .
Output: user
Based on the provided text "-lrb- at least -rrb- moore is a real charmer.", the sentiment seems to be positive. The phrase "real charmer" is generally used to describe someone who is likable and appealing, which indicates a positive sentiment. The inclusion of "-lrb- at least -rrb-" might suggest a slight reservation or context that the positivity is a minimum or baseline assessment, but it does not negate the positive sentiment towards Moore being a charmer.

The review "earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock" seems to be more on the neutral side. The words "earnest" and "tentative" do not convey a strong positive or negative sentiment. They suggest that the movie is sincere and cautious in its approach, even when it tries to be shocking. This doesn't necessarily indicate a positive or negative experience, but rather a balanced or neutral one.

The reviewer\'s sentiment is clearly not satisfied with the film, pointing out a significant lack of what they consider essential elements. This points towards a negative sentiment.\n\n<final_answer>negative</final_answer>\n\nInput: handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .\nOutput: user\nThe review describes the movie as "handsome and sincere" which are positive attributes, but it also mentions that the movie is "slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism," which introduces a negative aspect. The use of "slightly awkward" suggests that while there are some issues, they are not severe enough to completely detract from the overall impression. \n\nGiven the mixed nature of the feedback, with positive elements being acknowledged alongside some criticism, the sentiment leans more towards the middle of the spectrum.

The use of "unusually dry-eyed, even analytical" suggests that the movie takes a more detached or intellectual approach rather than an emotional one. This isn\'t necessarily negative; it\'s more about the style of the film. The phrase "played for maximum moisture" implies that the movie could have been made to be more emotionally manipulative, but it chose not to be. This could be seen as a positive trait for viewers who prefer a more thoughtful or less sentimental approach to storytelling.\n\nGiven the context, the sentiment seems to lean towards a positive appreciation of the film\'s unique approach, even if it\'s not overtly praising the film\'s quality or emotional impact.

Evaluate the sentiment expressed in the provided movie review and categorize it into one of the five specified emotional categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. After analyzing the sentiment of the given movie review, determine which of these five sentiment levels best represents its overall tone. Please conclude your analysis by enclosing your final choice with the markers <final_answer>chosen_sentiment</final_answer>.

Input: it may be a no-brainer , but at least it 's a funny no-brainer .
Output: user
Based on the review "it may be a no-brainer , but at least it 's a funny no-brainer.", the sentiment seems to be positive. The reviewer acknowledges that the movie might be simple or straightforward ("no-brainer"), but emphasizes that it is enjoyable and amusing.

Output: user
Based on the provided text "-lrb- at least -rrb- moore is a real charmer.", the sentiment seems to be positive. The phrase "real charmer" is generally used to describe someone who is likable and appealing, which indicates a positive sentiment. The inclusion of "-lrb- at least -rrb-" might suggest a slight reservation or context that the positivity is a minimum or baseline assessment, but it does not negate the positive sentiment towards Moore being a charmer.

Output: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>

Input: feels like nothing quite so much as a middle-aged moviemaker 's attempt to surround himself with beautiful , half-naked women .
Output: <final_answer>neutral</final_answer>

Input: earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock .
Output: user
The review "earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock" seems to be more on the neutral side. The words "earnest" and "tentative" do not convey a strong positive or negative sentiment. They suggest that the movie is sincere and cautious in its approach, even when it tries to be shocking. This doesn't necessarily indicate a positive or negative experience, but rather a balanced or neutral one.

"the work of an artist tormented by his heritage" - This phrase suggests a deep emotional struggle and a sense of burden or pain, which could be seen as negative. However, it also implies a level of depth and authenticity in the artist\'s work, which can be viewed positively.\n\n2. "using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims" - This indicates a noble purpose and a respectful approach to storytelling, which is generally seen as positive. The term "faceless victims" suggests a focus on underrepresented or forgotten individuals, which can be seen as a commendable effort to bring attention to their stories.\n\nConsidering these elements, the review seems to lean towards a positive sentiment, as it acknowledges the artist\'s struggle but emphasizes the noble purpose and the depth of the storytelling.

Input: it 's not too fast and not too slow .
Output: <final_answer>positive</final_answer>

Input: -lrb- at least -rrb- moore is a real charmer .
Output: user
Based on the provided text "-lrb- at least -rrb- moore is a real charmer.", the sentiment seems to be positive.

Based on the provided text "-lrb- at least -rrb- moore is a real charmer.", the sentiment seems to be positive. The phrase "real charmer" is generally used to describe someone who is likable and appealing, which indicates a positive sentiment.
