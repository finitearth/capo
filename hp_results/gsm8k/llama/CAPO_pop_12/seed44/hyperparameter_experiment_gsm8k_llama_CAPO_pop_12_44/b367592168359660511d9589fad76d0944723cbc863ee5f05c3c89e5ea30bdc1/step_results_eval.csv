Input:
Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she has already spent on the project. 

She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. So, the total hours spent so far is 10 + 2 = 12 hours.

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours to find out how many hours she has left. 

20 (total hours) - 12 (hours spent) = 8 hours.

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. Total hours in a day: 24 hours
2. Hours spent cleaning: 4 hours
3. Hours spent cooking: 2 hours
4. Hours spent sleeping: 8 hours

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping: 4 + 2 + 8 = 14 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day to find the remaining hours:
24 - 14 = 10 hours

Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
10 / 2 = 5 hours

So, Claire spent 5 hours crafting.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys. 

Now, we add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total: 39 + 60 = 99.

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
Jed collects stamp cards. Every week, he gets 6 cards. But every two weeks, he gives 2 cards to his friends. If Jed started with 20 cards, after how many weeks will he have a total of 40 cards?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. Jed starts with 20 cards.
2. Every week, he gets 6 new cards.
3. Every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards.

Let's calculate the net gain of cards per week. In a two-week period, Jed gets 6 * 2 = 12 new cards but gives away 2 cards. So, his net gain over two weeks is 12 - 2 = 10 cards.

To find the net gain per week, we divide the net gain over two weeks by 2. Thus, Jed's net gain per week is 10 / 2 = 5 cards.

Since Jed needs to go from 20 cards to 40 cards, he needs to gain 40 - 20 = 20 cards.

Given that Jed gains 5 cards per week, to gain 20 cards, he would need 20 / 5 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, after 4 weeks, Jed will have a total of 40 cards.

Output:
To find the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer, we need to calculate the number of black pens and blue pens first, and then add them to the number of red pens.

1. We know there are 8 red pens.
2. There are 10 more black pens than red pens. So, the number of black pens is 8 (red pens) + 10 = 18 black pens.
3. There are 7 more blue pens than red pens. So, the number of blue pens is 8 (red pens) + 7 = 15 blue pens.
4. Now, we add the number of red pens, black pens, and blue pens together to find the total number of pens: 8 (red) + 18 (black) + 15 (blue) = 41 pens.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half. This means the pizza is now in 2 pieces.
2. Then, he cuts both halves in half. So, each of the 2 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pieces.
3. Next, he cuts each of these 4 slices in half again. This means each of the 4 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 slices.

Now, we know there are 8 slices of pizza in total.

Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which is 3 * 1 = 3 slices.
- 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

In total, Phill gave out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

To find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given to his friends from the total number of slices:
8 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 1

Input:
Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Step 1: Determine the number of toys Hash has.
Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we first need to find half of the number of toys Bill has. Bill has 60 toys, so half of that is 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Step 2: Add 9 to the half of Bill's toys to find Hash's total.
Hash has 9 more than half of Bill's toys, so we add 9 to 30. 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Step 3: Add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total.
Bill has 60 toys, and Hash has 39 toys. So, the total number of toys is 60 + 39 = 99 toys.

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she has already spent on the project. 

She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. So, the total hours spent so far is 10 + 2 = 12 hours.

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours to find out how many hours she has left. 

20 (total hours) - 12 (hours spent) = 8 hours.

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. Total hours in a day: 24 hours
2. Hours spent cleaning: 4 hours
3. Hours spent cooking: 2 hours
4. Hours spent sleeping: 8 hours

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping: 4 + 2 + 8 = 14 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day to find the remaining hours:
24 - 14 = 10 hours

Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
10 / 2 = 5 hours

So, Claire spent 5 hours crafting.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys. 

Now, we add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total: 39 + 60 = 99.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
Jed collects stamp cards. Every week, he gets 6 cards. But every two weeks, he gives 2 cards to his friends. If Jed started with 20 cards, after how many weeks will he have a total of 40 cards?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. Jed starts with 20 cards.
2. Every week, he gets 6 new cards.
3. Every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards.

Let's calculate the net gain of cards per week. In a two-week period, Jed gets 6 * 2 = 12 new cards but gives away 2 cards. So, his net gain over two weeks is 12 - 2 = 10 cards.

To find the net gain per week, we divide the net gain over two weeks by 2. Thus, Jed's net gain per week is 10 / 2 = 5 cards.

Since Jed needs to go from 20 cards to 40 cards, he needs to gain 40 - 20 = 20 cards.

Given that Jed gains 5 cards per week, to gain 20 cards, he would need 20 / 5 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, after 4 weeks, Jed will have a total of 40 cards.

Output:
To find the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer, we need to calculate the number of black pens and blue pens first, and then add them to the number of red pens.

1. We know there are 8 red pens.
2. There are 10 more black pens than red pens. So, the number of black pens is 8 (red pens) + 10 = 18 black pens.
3. There are 7 more blue pens than red pens. So, the number of blue pens is 8 (red pens) + 7 = 15 blue pens.
4. Now, we add the number of red pens, black pens, and blue pens together to find the total number of pens: 8 (red) + 18 (black) + 15 (blue) = 41 pens.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half. This means the pizza is now in 2 pieces.
2. Then, he cuts both halves in half. So, each of the 2 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pieces.
3. Next, he cuts each of these 4 slices in half again. This means each of the 4 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 slices.

Now, we know there are 8 slices of pizza in total.

Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which is 3 * 1 = 3 slices.
- 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

In total, Phill gave out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

To find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given to his friends from the total number of slices:
8 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 1

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she has already spent on the project. 

She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. So, the total hours spent so far is 10 + 2 = 12 hours.

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours to find out how many hours she has left. 

20 (total hours) - 12 (hours spent) = 8 hours.

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours she has available.

First, let's calculate the total hours Jenny has spent so far:
Hours spent on research = 10 hours
Hours spent on writing a proposal = 2 hours
Total hours spent = 10 + 2 = 12 hours

Now, let's subtract the total hours spent from the total hours available:
Total hours available = 20 hours
Hours spent = 12 hours
Hours left = Total hours available - Hours spent = 20 - 12 = 8 hours

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys. 

Now, we add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total: 39 + 60 = 99.

Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. Total hours in a day: 24 hours
2. Hours spent cleaning: 4 hours
3. Hours spent cooking: 2 hours
4. Hours spent sleeping: 8 hours

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping: 4 + 2 + 8 = 14 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day to find the remaining hours:
24 - 14 = 10 hours

Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
10 / 2 = 5 hours

So, Claire spent 5 hours crafting.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys. 

Now, we add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total: 39 + 60 = 99.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Jed collects stamp cards. Every week, he gets 6 cards. But every two weeks, he gives 2 cards to his friends. If Jed started with 20 cards, after how many weeks will he have a total of 40 cards?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. Jed starts with 20 cards.
2. Every week, he gets 6 new cards.
3. Every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards.

Let's calculate the net gain of cards per week. In a two-week period, Jed gets 6 * 2 = 12 new cards but gives away 2 cards. So, his net gain over two weeks is 12 - 2 = 10 cards.

To find the net gain per week, we divide the net gain over two weeks by 2. Thus, Jed's net gain per week is 10 / 2 = 5 cards.

Since Jed needs to go from 20 cards to 40 cards, he needs to gain 40 - 20 = 20 cards.

Given that Jed gains 5 cards per week, to gain 20 cards, he would need 20 / 5 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, after 4 weeks, Jed will have a total of 40 cards.

1. We know there are 8 red pens.
2. There are 10 more black pens than red pens. So, the number of black pens is 8 (red pens) + 10 = 18 black pens.
3. There are 7 more blue pens than red pens. So, the number of blue pens is 8 (red pens) + 7 = 15 blue pens.
4. Now, we add the number of red pens, black pens, and blue pens together to find the total number of pens: 8 (red) + 18 (black) + 15 (blue) = 41 pens.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles.

Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Input:
Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys. 

Now, we add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total: 39 + 60 = 99.

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she has already spent on the project. 

She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. So, the total hours spent so far is 10 + 2 = 12 hours.

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours to find out how many hours she has left. 

20 (total hours) - 12 (hours spent) = 8 hours.

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours she has available.

First, let's calculate the total hours Jenny has spent so far:
Hours spent on research = 10 hours
Hours spent on writing a proposal = 2 hours
Total hours spent = 10 + 2 = 12 hours

Now, let's subtract the total hours spent from the total hours available:
Total hours available = 20 hours
Hours spent = 12 hours
Hours left = Total hours available - Hours spent = 20 - 12 = 8 hours

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many games each person won and then add them up.

Betsy won 5 games.
Helen won twice as many games as Betsy, so Helen won 2 x 5 = 10 games.
Susan won three times as many games as Betsy, so Susan won 3 x 5 = 15 games.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. Total hours in a day: 24 hours
2. Hours spent cleaning: 4 hours
3. Hours spent cooking: 2 hours
4. Hours spent sleeping: 8 hours

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping: 4 + 2 + 8 = 14 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day to find the remaining hours:
24 - 14 = 10 hours

Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
10 / 2 = 5 hours

So, Claire spent 5 hours crafting.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Jed collects stamp cards. Every week, he gets 6 cards. But every two weeks, he gives 2 cards to his friends. If Jed started with 20 cards, after how many weeks will he have a total of 40 cards?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. Jed starts with 20 cards.
2. Every week, he gets 6 new cards.
3. Every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards.

Let's calculate the net gain of cards per week. In a two-week period, Jed gets 6 * 2 = 12 new cards but gives away 2 cards. So, his net gain over two weeks is 12 - 2 = 10 cards.

To find the net gain per week, we divide the net gain over two weeks by 2. Thus, Jed's net gain per week is 10 / 2 = 5 cards.

Since Jed needs to go from 20 cards to 40 cards, he needs to gain 40 - 20 = 20 cards.

Given that Jed gains 5 cards per week, to gain 20 cards, he would need 20 / 5 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, after 4 weeks, Jed will have a total of 40 cards.

1. We know there are 8 red pens.
2. There are 10 more black pens than red pens. So, the number of black pens is 8 (red pens) + 10 = 18 black pens.
3. There are 7 more blue pens than red pens. So, the number of blue pens is 8 (red pens) + 7 = 15 blue pens.
4. Now, we add the number of red pens, black pens, and blue pens together to find the total number of pens: 8 (red) + 18 (black) + 15 (blue) = 41 pens.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Input:
Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys. 

Now, we add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total: 39 + 60 = 99.

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she has already spent on the project. 

She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. So, the total hours spent so far is 10 + 2 = 12 hours.

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours to find out how many hours she has left. 

20 (total hours) - 12 (hours spent) = 8 hours.

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours she has available.

First, let's calculate the total hours Jenny has spent so far:
Hours spent on research = 10 hours
Hours spent on writing a proposal = 2 hours
Total hours spent = 10 + 2 = 12 hours

Now, let's subtract the total hours spent from the total hours available:
Total hours available = 20 hours
Hours spent = 12 hours
Hours left = Total hours available - Hours spent = 20 - 12 = 8 hours

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many games each person won and then add them up.

Betsy won 5 games.
Helen won twice as many games as Betsy, so Helen won 2 x 5 = 10 games.
Susan won three times as many games as Betsy, so Susan won 3 x 5 = 15 games.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. Total hours in a day: 24 hours
2. Hours spent cleaning: 4 hours
3. Hours spent cooking: 2 hours
4. Hours spent sleeping: 8 hours

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping: 4 + 2 + 8 = 14 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day to find the remaining hours:
24 - 14 = 10 hours

Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
10 / 2 = 5 hours

So, Claire spent 5 hours crafting.

Jed collects stamp cards. Every week, he gets 6 cards. But every two weeks, he gives 2 cards to his friends. If Jed started with 20 cards, after how many weeks will he have a total of 40 cards?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. Jed starts with 20 cards.
2. Every week, he gets 6 new cards.
3. Every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards.

Let's calculate the net gain of cards per week. In a two-week period, Jed gets 6 * 2 = 12 new cards but gives away 2 cards. So, his net gain over two weeks is 12 - 2 = 10 cards.

To find the net gain per week, we divide the net gain over two weeks by 2. Thus, Jed's net gain per week is 10 / 2 = 5 cards.

Since Jed needs to go from 20 cards to 40 cards, he needs to gain 40 - 20 = 20 cards.

Given that Jed gains 5 cards per week, to gain 20 cards, he would need 20 / 5 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, after 4 weeks, Jed will have a total of 40 cards.

Output:
To find the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer, we need to calculate the number of black pens and blue pens first, and then add them to the number of red pens.

1. We know there are 8 red pens.
2. There are 10 more black pens than red pens. So, the number of black pens is 8 (red pens) + 10 = 18 black pens.
3. There are 7 more blue pens than red pens. So, the number of blue pens is 8 (red pens) + 7 = 15 blue pens.
4. Now, we add the number of red pens, black pens, and blue pens together to find the total number of pens: 8 (red) + 18 (black) + 15 (blue) = 41 pens.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she has already spent on the project. 

She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. So, the total hours spent so far is 10 + 2 = 12 hours.

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours to find out how many hours she has left. 

20 (total hours) - 12 (hours spent) = 8 hours.

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys. 

Now, we add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total: 39 + 60 = 99.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. Total hours in a day: 24 hours
2. Hours spent cleaning: 4 hours
3. Hours spent cooking: 2 hours
4. Hours spent sleeping: 8 hours

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping: 4 + 2 + 8 = 14 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day to find the remaining hours:
24 - 14 = 10 hours

Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
10 / 2 = 5 hours

So, Claire spent 5 hours crafting.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys. 

Now, we add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total: 39 + 60 = 99.

Input:
Jed collects stamp cards. Every week, he gets 6 cards. But every two weeks, he gives 2 cards to his friends. If Jed started with 20 cards, after how many weeks will he have a total of 40 cards?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. Jed starts with 20 cards.
2. Every week, he gets 6 new cards.
3. Every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards.

Let's calculate the net gain of cards per week. In a two-week period, Jed gets 6 * 2 = 12 new cards but gives away 2 cards. So, his net gain over two weeks is 12 - 2 = 10 cards.

To find the net gain per week, we divide the net gain over two weeks by 2. Thus, Jed's net gain per week is 10 / 2 = 5 cards.

Since Jed needs to go from 20 cards to 40 cards, he needs to gain 40 - 20 = 20 cards.

Given that Jed gains 5 cards per week, to gain 20 cards, he would need 20 / 5 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, after 4 weeks, Jed will have a total of 40 cards.

Output:
To find the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer, we need to calculate the number of black pens and blue pens first, and then add them to the number of red pens.

1. We know there are 8 red pens.
2. There are 10 more black pens than red pens. So, the number of black pens is 8 (red pens) + 10 = 18 black pens.
3. There are 7 more blue pens than red pens. So, the number of blue pens is 8 (red pens) + 7 = 15 blue pens.
4. Now, we add the number of red pens, black pens, and blue pens together to find the total number of pens: 8 (red) + 18 (black) + 15 (blue) = 41 pens.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she has already spent on the project. 

She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. So, the total hours spent so far is 10 + 2 = 12 hours.

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours to find out how many hours she has left. 

20 (total hours) - 12 (hours spent) = 8 hours.

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys. 

Now, we add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total: 39 + 60 = 99.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. Total hours in a day: 24 hours
2. Hours spent cleaning: 4 hours
3. Hours spent cooking: 2 hours
4. Hours spent sleeping: 8 hours

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping: 4 + 2 + 8 = 14 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day to find the remaining hours:
24 - 14 = 10 hours

Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
10 / 2 = 5 hours

So, Claire spent 5 hours crafting.

Input:
Jed collects stamp cards. Every week, he gets 6 cards. But every two weeks, he gives 2 cards to his friends. If Jed started with 20 cards, after how many weeks will he have a total of 40 cards?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. Jed starts with 20 cards.
2. Every week, he gets 6 new cards.
3. Every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards.

Let's calculate the net gain of cards per week. In a two-week period, Jed gets 6 * 2 = 12 new cards but gives away 2 cards. So, his net gain over two weeks is 12 - 2 = 10 cards.

To find the net gain per week, we divide the net gain over two weeks by 2. Thus, Jed's net gain per week is 10 / 2 = 5 cards.

Since Jed needs to go from 20 cards to 40 cards, he needs to gain 40 - 20 = 20 cards.

Given that Jed gains 5 cards per week, to gain 20 cards, he would need 20 / 5 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, after 4 weeks, Jed will have a total of 40 cards.

Output:
To find the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer, we need to calculate the number of black pens and blue pens first, and then add them to the number of red pens.

1. We know there are 8 red pens.
2. There are 10 more black pens than red pens. So, the number of black pens is 8 (red pens) + 10 = 18 black pens.
3. There are 7 more blue pens than red pens. So, the number of blue pens is 8 (red pens) + 7 = 15 blue pens.
4. Now, we add the number of red pens, black pens, and blue pens together to find the total number of pens: 8 (red) + 18 (black) + 15 (blue) = 41 pens.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later.

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she has already spent on the project. 

She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. So, the total hours spent so far is 10 + 2 = 12 hours.

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours to find out how many hours she has left. 

20 (total hours) - 12 (hours spent) = 8 hours.

Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys. 

Now, we add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total: 39 + 60 = 99.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. Total hours in a day: 24 hours
2. Hours spent cleaning: 4 hours
3. Hours spent cooking: 2 hours
4. Hours spent sleeping: 8 hours

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping: 4 + 2 + 8 = 14 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day to find the remaining hours:
24 - 14 = 10 hours

Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
10 / 2 = 5 hours

So, Claire spent 5 hours crafting.

Input:
Jed collects stamp cards. Every week, he gets 6 cards. But every two weeks, he gives 2 cards to his friends. If Jed started with 20 cards, after how many weeks will he have a total of 40 cards?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. Jed starts with 20 cards.
2. Every week, he gets 6 new cards.
3. Every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards.

Let's calculate the net gain of cards per week. In a two-week period, Jed gets 6 * 2 = 12 new cards but gives away 2 cards. So, his net gain over two weeks is 12 - 2 = 10 cards.

To find the net gain per week, we divide the net gain over two weeks by 2. Thus, Jed's net gain per week is 10 / 2 = 5 cards.

Since Jed needs to go from 20 cards to 40 cards, he needs to gain 40 - 20 = 20 cards.

Given that Jed gains 5 cards per week, to gain 20 cards, he would need 20 / 5 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, after 4 weeks, Jed will have a total of 40 cards.

Output:
To find the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer, we need to calculate the number of black pens and blue pens first, and then add them to the number of red pens.

1. We know there are 8 red pens.
2. There are 10 more black pens than red pens. So, the number of black pens is 8 (red pens) + 10 = 18 black pens.
3. There are 7 more blue pens than red pens. So, the number of blue pens is 8 (red pens) + 7 = 15 blue pens.
4. Now, we add the number of red pens, black pens, and blue pens together to find the total number of pens: 8 (red) + 18 (black) + 15 (blue) = 41 pens.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Betsy won 5 games of Monopoly.  Helen won twice as many as Betsy and Susan won three times as many as Betsy.  Between them, how many games have they won?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many games each person won and then add them up.

Betsy won 5 games.
Helen won twice as many games as Betsy, so Helen won 2 x 5 = 10 games.
Susan won three times as many games as Betsy, so Susan won 3 x 5 = 15 games.

Now, let's add up the number of games each person won:
5 (Betsy) + 10 (Helen) + 15 (Susan) = 30

So, between them, they have won <final_answer>30</final_answer> games.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she has already spent on the project. 

She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. So, the total hours spent so far is 10 + 2 = 12 hours.

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours to find out how many hours she has left. 

20 (total hours) - 12 (hours spent) = 8 hours.

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. Total hours in a day: 24 hours
2. Hours spent cleaning: 4 hours
3. Hours spent cooking: 2 hours
4. Hours spent sleeping: 8 hours

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping: 4 + 2 + 8 = 14 hours

Now, subtract these hours from the total hours in a day to find the remaining hours:
24 - 14 = 10 hours

Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
10 / 2 = 5 hours

So, Claire spent 5 hours crafting.

Jed collects stamp cards. Every week, he gets 6 cards. But every two weeks, he gives 2 cards to his friends. If Jed started with 20 cards, after how many weeks will he have a total of 40 cards?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. Jed starts with 20 cards.
2. Every week, he gets 6 new cards.
3. Every two weeks, he gives away 2 cards.

Let's calculate the net gain of cards per week. In a two-week period, Jed gets 6 * 2 = 12 new cards but gives away 2 cards. So, his net gain over two weeks is 12 - 2 = 10 cards.

To find the net gain per week, we divide the net gain over two weeks by 2. Thus, Jed's net gain per week is 10 / 2 = 5 cards.

Since Jed needs to go from 20 cards to 40 cards, he needs to gain 40 - 20 = 20 cards.

Given that Jed gains 5 cards per week, to gain 20 cards, he would need 20 / 5 = 4 weeks.

Therefore, after 4 weeks, Jed will have a total of 40 cards.

Output:
To find the total number of pens in Maria's desk drawer, we need to calculate the number of black pens and blue pens first, and then add them to the number of red pens.

1. We know there are 8 red pens.
2. There are 10 more black pens than red pens. So, the number of black pens is 8 (red pens) + 10 = 18 black pens.
3. There are 7 more blue pens than red pens. So, the number of blue pens is 8 (red pens) + 7 = 15 blue pens.
4. Now, we add the number of red pens, black pens, and blue pens together to find the total number of pens: 8 (red) + 18 (black) + 15 (blue) = 41 pens.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Bill has 60 toys. Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. 

First, we need to find half of the number of toys Bill has: 60 / 2 = 30.

Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we add 9 to 30: 30 + 9 = 39.

So, Hash has 39 toys. 

Now, we add the number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total: 39 + 60 = 99.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.

Betsy won 5 games of Monopoly.  Helen won twice as many as Betsy and Susan won three times as many as Betsy.  Between them, how many games have they won?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many games each person won and then add them up.

Betsy won 5 games.
Helen won twice as many games as Betsy, so Helen won 2 x 5 = 10 games.
Susan won three times as many games as Betsy, so Susan won 3 x 5 = 15 games.

Now, let's add up the number of games each person won:
5 (Betsy) + 10 (Helen) + 15 (Susan) = 30

So, between them, they have won <final_answer>30</final_answer> games.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we need to first calculate the total number of hours she has already spent on the project. 

She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. So, the total hours spent so far is 10 + 2 = 12 hours.

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours to find out how many hours she has left. 

20 (total hours) - 12 (hours spent) = 8 hours.

So, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes.
2. She folds half of them by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500.
3. After folding 500, she has 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.
4. A friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100.
5. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes, leaving 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes that still need to be folded.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranes.
