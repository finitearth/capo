A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To find out how many lives a mouse has, we need to first determine the number of lives a dog has, since the number of lives a mouse has is compared to that of a dog.

1. A cat has 9 lives.
2. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, the number of lives a dog has is 9 - 3 = 6.
3. A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. Since a dog has 6 lives, a mouse has 6 + 7 = 13 lives.

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Input:
Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda, and Candice read 18 books. So, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Amanda read:
   Let's denote the number of books Amanda read as A.
   Since Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda, we have: 3A = 18
   Solving for A gives us: A = 18 / 3 = 6

2. Now that we know Amanda read 6 books, we can find out how many books Kara read. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read:
   Kara's books = A / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3

3. Finally, we know Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read:
   Patricia's books = 7 * Kara's books = 7 * 3 = 21

So, Patricia read 21 books.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randyâ€™s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of biscuits Randy has after each event.

First, Randy starts with 32 biscuits.

Then, his father gives him 13 biscuits as a gift. To find the total number of biscuits Randy has now, we add 13 to 32:
32 + 13 = 45

Next, his mother gives him 15 biscuits. We add 15 to the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving the gift from his father:
45 + 15 = 60

Finally, Randy's brother eats 20 biscuits. To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we subtract 20 from the total number of biscuits he had after receiving gifts from both his father and mother:
60 - 20 = 40

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into logical steps:

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems.
3. The total number of problems she completed after 40 minutes is 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.
4. The test has 75 problems in total, and she has completed 30 problems.
5. To find out how many problems she has left to solve, we subtract the number of problems she has completed from the total number of problems: 75 - 30 = 45.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into logical steps:

1. First, we need to determine how much milk one cow produces per week. Since every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide 108 by 6 to find out how much milk one cow produces per week.
   - Milk per cow per week = 108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

2. Next, we know that in five weeks, the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. To find out how much milk all the cows produce per week, we divide the total milk produced by the number of weeks.
   - Total milk per week = 2160 liters / 5 weeks = 432 liters per week.

3. Now, we know that one cow produces 18 liters of milk per week. To find out how many cows are on the farm, we divide the total milk produced per week by the amount of milk one cow produces per week.
   - Number of cows = Total milk per week / Milk per cow per week = 432 liters / 18 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Therefore, the solution to the problem is that there are <final_answer>24</final_answer> cows

Julie runs the school newspaper. In preparation for printing the next issue of The School News, she bought two boxes of standard paper, each containing 5 packages, with 250 sheets of paper per package.  If this issue of The School News uses 25 sheets of paper to print one newspaper, how many newspapers can Julie print with the paper that she purchased?
Output:
To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, we first need to calculate the total number of sheets of paper she has.

1. Each box contains 5 packages of paper.
2. Each package contains 250 sheets of paper.
3. So, the total number of sheets in one box is 5 packages * 250 sheets/package = 1250 sheets.
4. Since Julie bought two boxes, she has 2 * 1250 sheets = 2500 sheets in total.
5. Each newspaper requires 25 sheets of paper to print.
6. To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, we divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets per newspaper: 2500 sheets / 25 sheets/newspaper.

Calculating this gives us: 2500 / 25 = 100.

So, Julie can print <final_answer>100</final_answer> newspapers with the paper she purchased.

Input:
A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To find out how many lives a mouse has, we need to first determine the number of lives a dog has, since the number of lives a mouse has is compared to that of a dog.

1. A cat has 9 lives.
2. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, the number of lives a dog has is 9 - 3 = 6.
3. A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. Since a dog has 6 lives, a mouse has 6 + 7 = 13 lives.

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randyâ€™s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of biscuits Randy has after each event.

First, Randy starts with 32 biscuits.

Then, his father gives him 13 biscuits as a gift. To find the total number of biscuits Randy has now, we add 13 to 32:
32 + 13 = 45

Next, his mother gives him 15 biscuits. We add 15 to the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving the gift from his father:
45 + 15 = 60

Finally, Randy's brother eats 20 biscuits. To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we subtract 20 from the total number of biscuits he had after receiving gifts from both his father and mother:
60 - 20 = 40

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Input:
A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To find out how many lives a mouse has, we need to first determine the number of lives a dog has, since the number of lives a mouse has is compared to that of a dog.

1. A cat has 9 lives.
2. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, the number of lives a dog has is 9 - 3 = 6.
3. A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. Since a dog has 6 lives, a mouse has 6 + 7 = 13 lives.

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randyâ€™s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of biscuits Randy has after each event.

First, Randy starts with 32 biscuits.

Then, his father gives him 13 biscuits as a gift. To find the total number of biscuits Randy has now, we add 13 to 32:
32 + 13 = 45

Next, his mother gives him 15 biscuits. We add 15 to the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving the gift from his father:
45 + 15 = 60

Finally, Randy's brother eats 20 biscuits. To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we subtract 20 from the total number of biscuits he had after receiving gifts from both his father and mother:
60 - 20 = 40

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randyâ€™s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of biscuits Randy has after each event.

First, Randy starts with 32 biscuits.

Then, his father gives him 13 biscuits as a gift. To find the total number of biscuits Randy has now, we add 13 to 32:
32 + 13 = 45

Next, his mother gives him 15 biscuits. We add 15 to the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving the gift from his father:
45 + 15 = 60

Finally, Randy's brother eats 20 biscuits. To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we subtract 20 from the total number of biscuits he had after receiving gifts from both his father and mother:
60 - 20 = 40

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randyâ€™s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of biscuits Randy has after each event.

First, Randy starts with 32 biscuits.

Then, his father gives him 13 biscuits as a gift. To find the total number of biscuits Randy has now, we add 13 to 32:
32 + 13 = 45

Next, his mother gives him 15 biscuits. We add 15 to the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving the gift from his father:
45 + 15 = 60

Finally, Randy's brother eats 20 biscuits. To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we subtract 20 from the total number of biscuits he had after receiving gifts from both his father and mother:
60 - 20 = 40

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Input:
Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randyâ€™s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of biscuits Randy has after each event.

First, Randy starts with 32 biscuits.

Then, his father gives him 13 biscuits as a gift. To find the total number of biscuits Randy has now, we add 13 to 32:
32 + 13 = 45

Next, his mother gives him 15 biscuits. We add 15 to the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving the gift from his father:
45 + 15 = 60

Finally, Randy's brother eats 20 biscuits. To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we subtract 20 from the total number of biscuits he had after receiving gifts from both his father and mother:
60 - 20 = 40

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To find out how many lives a mouse has, we need to first determine the number of lives a dog has, since the number of lives a mouse has is compared to that of a dog.

1. A cat has 9 lives.
2. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, the number of lives a dog has is 9 - 3 = 6.
3. A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. Since a dog has 6 lives, a mouse has 6 + 7 = 13 lives.

Next, his mother gives him 15 biscuits. We add 15 to the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving the gift from his father:
45 + 15 = 60

Finally, Randy's brother eats 20 biscuits. To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we subtract 20 from the total number of biscuits he had after receiving gifts from both his father and mother:
60 - 20 = 40

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of biscuits Randy has after each event.

First, Randy starts with 32 biscuits.

Then, his father gives him 13 biscuits as a gift. To find the total number of biscuits Randy has now, we add 13 to 32:
32 + 13 = 45

Next, his mother gives him 15 biscuits. We add 15 to the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving the gift from his father:
45 + 15 = 60

Finally, Randy's brother eats 20 biscuits. To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we subtract 20 from the total number of biscuits he had after receiving gifts from both his father and mother:
60 - 20 = 40

To find out how many lives a mouse has, we need to first determine the number of lives a dog has, since the number of lives a mouse has is compared to that of a dog.

1. A cat has 9 lives.
2. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, the number of lives a dog has is 9 - 3 = 6.
3. A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. Since a dog has 6 lives, a mouse has 6 + 7 = 13 lives.

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randyâ€™s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of biscuits Randy has after each event.

First, Randy starts with 32 biscuits.

Then, his father gives him 13 biscuits as a gift. To find the total number of biscuits Randy has now, we add 13 to 32:
32 + 13 = 45

Next, his mother gives him 15 biscuits. We add 15 to the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving the gift from his father:
45 + 15 = 60

Finally, Randy's brother eats 20 biscuits. To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we subtract 20 from the total number of biscuits he had after receiving gifts from both his father and mother:
60 - 20 = 40

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Input:
A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To find out how many lives a mouse has, we need to first determine the number of lives a dog has, since the number of lives a mouse has is compared to that of a dog.

1. A cat has 9 lives.
2. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, the number of lives a dog has is 9 - 3 = 6.
3. A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. Since a dog has 6 lives, a mouse has 6 + 7 = 13 lives.

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Input:
Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randyâ€™s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and calculate the total number of biscuits Randy has after each event.

First, Randy starts with 32 biscuits.

Then, his father gives him 13 biscuits as a gift. To find the total number of biscuits Randy has now, we add 13 to 32:
32 + 13 = 45

Next, his mother gives him 15 biscuits. We add 15 to the total number of biscuits Randy had after receiving the gift from his father:
45 + 15 = 60

Finally, Randy's brother eats 20 biscuits. To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we subtract 20 from the total number of biscuits he had after receiving gifts from both his father and mother:
60 - 20 = 40

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.
