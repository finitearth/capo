Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Input:
Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda. Since Candice read 18 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Amanda read:
   Candice's books = 3 * Amanda's books
   18 = 3 * Amanda's books
   Amanda's books = 18 / 3
   Amanda's books = 6

2. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read. Since Amanda read 6 books, we can find out how many books Kara read:
   Kara's books = Amanda's books / 2
   Kara's books = 6 / 2
   Kara's books = 3

3. Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. Since Kara read 3 books, we can find out how many books Patricia read:
   Patricia's books = 7 * Kara's books
   Patricia's books = 7 * 3
   Patricia's books = 21

So, Patricia read 21 books.

Input:
Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz giving her an average of 94. What is Lizette's average in her first two quizzes?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that the average score is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Let's denote the scores of Lizette's first two quizzes as x and y. We know that she scored 92 on her third quiz.

The average of the three quizzes is given as 94. We can set up an equation based on this information:

(x + y + 92) / 3 = 94

To find the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

x + y + 92 = 94 * 3
x + y + 92 = 282

Now, we can subtract 92 from both sides to isolate the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes:

x + y = 282 - 92
x + y = 190

Since we are asked to find the average of the first two quizzes, we need to divide the sum of their scores by 2:

(x + y) / 2 = 190 / 2
Average = 95

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, to find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Output:
To find the total number of birds Camille saw, we need to calculate the number of each type of bird she saw and then add them together.

1. **Cardinals**: Camille saw 3 cardinals.

2. **Robins**: She saw four times as many robins as cardinals. Since she saw 3 cardinals, she saw 4 * 3 = 12 robins.

3. **Blue Jays**: Camille saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals. So, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 blue jays.

4. **Sparrows**: She saw 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals. Since she saw 3 cardinals, three times that number is 3 * 3 = 9. One more than that is 9 + 1 = 10 sparrows.

Now, we add up the number of each type of bird to find the total number of birds Camille saw:
- Cardinals: 3
- Robins: 12
- Blue Jays: 6
- Sparrows: 10

Total = 3 + 12 + 6 + 10 = 31

Tom Brady is shy of the passing yards record in a season. The current record is 5999 yards. He currently has 4200 yards with 6 games left in the season. How many passing yards per game does he need to average to beat the record?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many passing yards Tom Brady needs to beat the record, and then divide that number by the number of games he has left in the season.

Step 1: Determine how many passing yards Tom Brady needs to beat the record.
The current record is 5999 yards, so to beat the record, Tom Brady needs at least 6000 yards. Since he currently has 4200 yards, we need to find out how many more yards he needs:
6000 (yards needed to beat the record) - 4200 (current yards) = 1800 yards

Step 2: Determine how many games Tom Brady has left in the season.
Tom Brady has 6 games left in the season.

Step 3: Calculate how many passing yards per game Tom Brady needs to average to beat the record.
To find the average yards per game, we divide the total yards needed (1800) by the number of games left (6):
1800 yards / 6 games = 300 yards per game

Therefore, Tom Brady needs to average at least 300 passing yards per game to beat the record.

So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz giving her an average of 94. What is Lizette's average in her first two quizzes?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that the average score is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Let's denote the scores of Lizette's first two quizzes as x and y. We know that she scored 92 on her third quiz.

The average of the three quizzes is given as 94. We can set up an equation based on this information:

(x + y + 92) / 3 = 94

To find the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

x + y + 92 = 94 * 3
x + y + 92 = 282

Now, we can subtract 92 from both sides to isolate the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes:

x + y = 282 - 92
x + y = 190

Since we are asked to find the average of the first two quizzes, we need to divide the sum of their scores by 2:

(x + y) / 2 = 190 / 2
Average = 95

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda. Since Candice read 18 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Amanda read:
   Candice's books = 3 * Amanda's books
   18 = 3 * Amanda's books
   Amanda's books = 18 / 3
   Amanda's books = 6

2. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read. Since Amanda read 6 books, we can find out how many books Kara read:
   Kara's books = Amanda's books / 2
   Kara's books = 6 / 2
   Kara's books = 3

3. Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. Since Kara read 3 books, we can find out how many books Patricia read:
   Patricia's books = 7 * Kara's books
   Patricia's books = 7 * 3
   Patricia's books = 21

So, Patricia read 21 books.

Camille saw 3 cardinals and four times as many robins as cardinals while bird watching. She also saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals and 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals. How many birds did Camille see?
Output:
To find the total number of birds Camille saw, we need to calculate the number of each type of bird she saw and then add them together.

1. **Cardinals**: Camille saw 3 cardinals.

2. **Robins**: She saw four times as many robins as cardinals. Since she saw 3 cardinals, she saw 4 * 3 = 12 robins.

3. **Blue Jays**: Camille saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals. So, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 blue jays.

4. **Sparrows**: She saw 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals. Since she saw 3 cardinals, three times that number is 3 * 3 = 9. One more than that is 9 + 1 = 10 sparrows.

Now, we add up the number of each type of bird to find the total number of birds Camille saw:
- Cardinals: 3
- Robins: 12
- Blue Jays: 6
- Sparrows: 10

Total = 3 + 12 + 6 + 10 = 31

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:

On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, to find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Camille saw 3 cardinals and four times as many robins as cardinals while bird watching. She also saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals and 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals. How many birds did Camille see?
Output:
To find the total number of birds Camille saw, we need to calculate the number of each type of bird she saw and then add them together.

1. **Cardinals**: Camille saw 3 cardinals.

2. **Robins**: She saw four times as many robins as cardinals. Since she saw 3 cardinals, she saw 4 * 3 = 12 robins.

3. **Blue Jays**: Camille saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals. So, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 blue jays.

4. **Sparrows**: She saw 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals. Since she saw 3 cardinals, three times that number is 3 * 3 = 9. One more than that is 9 + 1 = 10 sparrows.

Now, we add up the number of each type of bird to find the total number of birds Camille saw:
- Cardinals: 3
- Robins: 12
- Blue Jays: 6
- Sparrows: 10

Total = 3 + 12 + 6 + 10 = 31

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, to find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Input:
Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz giving her an average of 94. What is Lizette's average in her first two quizzes?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that the average score is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Let's denote the scores of Lizette's first two quizzes as x and y. We know that she scored 92 on her third quiz.

The average of the three quizzes is given as 94. We can set up an equation based on this information:

(x + y + 92) / 3 = 94

To find the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

x + y + 92 = 94 * 3
x + y + 92 = 282

Now, we can subtract 92 from both sides to isolate the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes:

x + y = 282 - 92
x + y = 190

Since we are asked to find the average of the first two quizzes, we need to divide the sum of their scores by 2:

(x + y) / 2 = 190 / 2
Average = 95

The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Input:
A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, to find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz giving her an average of 94. What is Lizette's average in her first two quizzes?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that the average score is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Let's denote the scores of Lizette's first two quizzes as x and y. We know that she scored 92 on her third quiz.

The average of the three quizzes is given as 94. We can set up an equation based on this information:

(x + y + 92) / 3 = 94

To find the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

x + y + 92 = 94 * 3
x + y + 92 = 282

Now, we can subtract 92 from both sides to isolate the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes:

x + y = 282 - 92
x + y = 190

Since we are asked to find the average of the first two quizzes, we need to divide the sum of their scores by 2:

(x + y) / 2 = 190 / 2
Average = 95

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, to find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz giving her an average of 94. What is Lizette's average in her first two quizzes?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that the average score is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Let's denote the scores of Lizette's first two quizzes as x and y. We know that she scored 92 on her third quiz.

The average of the three quizzes is given as 94. We can set up an equation based on this information:

(x + y + 92) / 3 = 94

To find the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

x + y + 92 = 94 * 3
x + y + 92 = 282

Now, we can subtract 92 from both sides to isolate the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes:

x + y = 282 - 92
x + y = 190

Since we are asked to find the average of the first two quizzes, we need to divide the sum of their scores by 2:

(x + y) / 2 = 190 / 2
Average = 95

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, to find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Input:
Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz giving her an average of 94. What is Lizette's average in her first two quizzes?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that the average score is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Let's denote the scores of Lizette's first two quizzes as x and y. We know that she scored 92 on her third quiz.

The average of the three quizzes is given as 94. We can set up an equation based on this information:

(x + y + 92) / 3 = 94

To find the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

x + y + 92 = 94 * 3
x + y + 92 = 282

Now, we can subtract 92 from both sides to isolate the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes:

x + y = 282 - 92
x + y = 190

Since we are asked to find the average of the first two quizzes, we need to divide the sum of their scores by 2:

(x + y) / 2 = 190 / 2
Average = 95

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, to find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz giving her an average of 94. What is Lizette's average in her first two quizzes?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that the average score is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Let's denote the scores of Lizette's first two quizzes as x and y. We know that she scored 92 on her third quiz.

The average of the three quizzes is given as 94. We can set up an equation based on this information:

(x + y + 92) / 3 = 94

To find the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

x + y + 92 = 94 * 3
x + y + 92 = 282

Now, we can subtract 92 from both sides to isolate the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes:

x + y = 282 - 92
x + y = 190

Since we are asked to find the average of the first two quizzes, we need to divide the sum of their scores by 2:

(x + y) / 2 = 190 / 2
Average = 95

To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, to find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Input:
Lizette scored 92 on her third quiz giving her an average of 94. What is Lizette's average in her first two quizzes?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to understand that the average score is calculated by adding up all the scores and dividing by the number of scores. Let's denote the scores of Lizette's first two quizzes as x and y. We know that she scored 92 on her third quiz.

The average of the three quizzes is given as 94. We can set up an equation based on this information:

(x + y + 92) / 3 = 94

To find the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes, we can multiply both sides of the equation by 3 to get rid of the fraction:

x + y + 92 = 94 * 3
x + y + 92 = 282

Now, we can subtract 92 from both sides to isolate the sum of the scores of the first two quizzes:

x + y = 282 - 92
x + y = 190

Since we are asked to find the average of the first two quizzes, we need to divide the sum of their scores by 2:

(x + y) / 2 = 190 / 2
Average = 95

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, to find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.
