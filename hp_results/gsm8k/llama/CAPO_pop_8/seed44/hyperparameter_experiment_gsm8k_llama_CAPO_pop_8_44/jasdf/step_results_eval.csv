Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Step 1: Determine the number of toys Hash has.
Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has, and Bill has 60 toys, we first need to find half of Bill's toys.
Half of Bill's toys = 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys Hash has.
Hash has 9 more toys than half of Bill's toys.
So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Step 3: Find the total number of toys the boys have.
To find the total number of toys, we add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has.
Total toys = Bill's toys + Hash's toys = 60 + 39 = 99 toys.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.

Next, a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are left for Alice to fold. There were 500 paper cranes left after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of them. So, the number of paper cranes left for Alice to fold is 500 - 100 = 400.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold <final_answer>400</final_answer> paper cranes.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has. We know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we can start by finding half of Bill's toys.

Half of Bill's toys is 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more toys than this amount, so we add 9 to 30:

30 + 9 = 39 toys.

This means Hash has 39 toys. To find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39):

60 + 39 = 99 toys.

So, the total number of toys the boys have is <final_answer>99</final_answer>.

George and Harry want to fill a pool with buckets. George can carry two buckets each round, and Harry can carry three buckets each round. If it takes 110 buckets to fill the pool, how many rounds will it take to fill the pool?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many buckets George and Harry can carry together in one round, and then divide the total number of buckets needed to fill the pool by that number.

First, let's find out how many buckets George and Harry can carry together in one round:
George can carry 2 buckets per round.
Harry can carry 3 buckets per round.
Together, they can carry 2 + 3 = 5 buckets per round.

Now, let's divide the total number of buckets needed to fill the pool (110) by the number of buckets they can carry together in one round (5):
110 buckets / 5 buckets per round = 22 rounds

So, it will take George and Harry 22 rounds to fill the pool.

Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know that Barry will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. Let's denote the number of cucumbers as C and the number of tomatoes as T. We can write an equation based on the total number of vegetables:

C + T = 280

We are also told that there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers. This means that the number of tomatoes is three times the number of cucumbers. We can write this relationship as:

T = 3C

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for C:

C + 3C = 280

Combine like terms:

4C = 280

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for C:

C = 280 / 4
C = 70

So, the number of cucumbers that will be used in the salad is 70.

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we first need to calculate the total hours she has already spent on the project. She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. 

Total hours spent so far = hours spent on research + hours spent on proposal
Total hours spent so far = 10 hours + 2 hours
Total hours spent so far = 12 hours

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours available to find out how many hours she has left.

Hours left = Total hours available - Total hours spent so far
Hours left = 20 hours - 12 hours
Hours left = 8 hours

Therefore, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
George and Harry want to fill a pool with buckets. George can carry two buckets each round, and Harry can carry three buckets each round. If it takes 110 buckets to fill the pool, how many rounds will it take to fill the pool?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many buckets George and Harry can carry together in one round, and then divide the total number of buckets needed to fill the pool by that number.

First, let's find out how many buckets George and Harry can carry together in one round:
George can carry 2 buckets per round.
Harry can carry 3 buckets per round.
Together, they can carry 2 + 3 = 5 buckets per round.

Now, let's divide the total number of buckets needed to fill the pool (110) by the number of buckets they can carry together in one round (5):
110 buckets / 5 buckets per round = 22 rounds

So, it will take George and Harry 22 rounds to fill the pool.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Step 1: Determine the number of toys Hash has.
Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has, and Bill has 60 toys, we first need to find half of Bill's toys.
Half of Bill's toys = 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys Hash has.
Hash has 9 more toys than half of Bill's toys.
So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Step 3: Find the total number of toys the boys have.
To find the total number of toys, we add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has.
Total toys = Bill's toys + Hash's toys = 60 + 39 = 99 toys.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.

Next, a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are left for Alice to fold. There were 500 paper cranes left after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of them. So, the number of paper cranes left for Alice to fold is 500 - 100 = 400.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold <final_answer>400</final_answer> paper cranes.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Input:
Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has. We know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we can start by finding half of Bill's toys.

Half of Bill's toys is 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more toys than this amount, so we add 9 to 30:

30 + 9 = 39 toys.

This means Hash has 39 toys. To find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39):

60 + 39 = 99 toys.

So, the total number of toys the boys have is <final_answer>99</final_answer>.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.

Next, a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are left for Alice to fold. There were 500 paper cranes left after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of them. So, the number of paper cranes left for Alice to fold is 500 - 100 = 400.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold <final_answer>400</final_answer> paper cranes.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has. We know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we can start by finding half of Bill's toys.

Half of Bill's toys is 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more toys than this amount, so we add 9 to 30:

30 + 9 = 39 toys.

This means Hash has 39 toys. To find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39):

60 + 39 = 99 toys.

So, the total number of toys the boys have is <final_answer>99</final_answer>.

Input:
Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Step 1: Determine the number of toys Hash has.
Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has, and Bill has 60 toys, we first need to find half of Bill's toys.
Half of Bill's toys = 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys Hash has.
Hash has 9 more toys than half of Bill's toys.
So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Step 3: Find the total number of toys the boys have.
To find the total number of toys, we add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has.
Total toys = Bill's toys + Hash's toys = 60 + 39 = 99 toys.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

George and Harry want to fill a pool with buckets. George can carry two buckets each round, and Harry can carry three buckets each round. If it takes 110 buckets to fill the pool, how many rounds will it take to fill the pool?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many buckets George and Harry can carry together in one round, and then divide the total number of buckets needed to fill the pool by that number.

First, let's find out how many buckets George and Harry can carry together in one round:
George can carry 2 buckets per round.
Harry can carry 3 buckets per round.
Together, they can carry 2 + 3 = 5 buckets per round.

Now, let's divide the total number of buckets needed to fill the pool (110) by the number of buckets they can carry together in one round (5):
110 buckets / 5 buckets per round = 22 rounds

So, it will take George and Harry 22 rounds to fill the pool.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Step 1: Determine the number of toys Hash has.
Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has, and Bill has 60 toys, we first need to find half of Bill's toys.
Half of Bill's toys = 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys Hash has.
Hash has 9 more toys than half of Bill's toys.
So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Step 3: Find the total number of toys the boys have.
To find the total number of toys, we add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has.
Total toys = Bill's toys + Hash's toys = 60 + 39 = 99 toys.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Input:
George and Harry want to fill a pool with buckets. George can carry two buckets each round, and Harry can carry three buckets each round. If it takes 110 buckets to fill the pool, how many rounds will it take to fill the pool?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find out how many buckets George and Harry can carry together in one round, and then divide the total number of buckets needed to fill the pool by that number.

First, let's find out how many buckets George and Harry can carry together in one round:
George can carry 2 buckets per round.
Harry can carry 3 buckets per round.
Together, they can carry 2 + 3 = 5 buckets per round.

Now, let's divide the total number of buckets needed to fill the pool (110) by the number of buckets they can carry together in one round (5):
110 buckets / 5 buckets per round = 22 rounds

So, it will take George and Harry 22 rounds to fill the pool.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.
