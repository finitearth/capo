Input:
Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To find out how many more pages Cyrus needs to write, we need to calculate the total number of pages he has written so far and subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to write, which is 500.

On the first day, Cyrus wrote 25 pages.
On the second day, he wrote twice that amount, which is 2 x 25 = 50 pages.
On the third day, he wrote twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 x 50 = 100 pages.
On the fourth day, he wrote 10 pages.

The total number of pages Cyrus has written so far is:
25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages.

Since Cyrus needs to write a total of 500 pages, he needs to write:
500 - 185 = 315 more pages.

Output:
To find out how many more pages Cyrus needs to write, we need to calculate the total number of pages he has written so far and subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to write, which is 500.

On the first day, Cyrus wrote 25 pages.
On the second day, he wrote twice that amount, which is 2 x 25 = 50 pages.
On the third day, he wrote twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 x 50 = 100 pages.
On the fourth day, he wrote 10 pages.

The total number of pages Cyrus has written so far is:
25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages.

To find out how many more pages Cyrus needs to write, we need to calculate the total number of pages he has written so far and subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to write, which is 500.

On the first day, Cyrus wrote 25 pages.
On the second day, he wrote twice that amount, which is 2 x 25 = 50 pages.
On the third day, he wrote twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 x 50 = 100 pages.
On the fourth day, he wrote 10 pages.

The total number of pages Cyrus has written so far is:
25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages.

Since Cyrus needs to write a total of 500 pages, he needs to write:
500 - 185 = 315 more pages.

Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To find out how many more pages Cyrus needs to write, we need to calculate the total number of pages he has written so far and subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to write, which is 500.

On the first day, Cyrus wrote 25 pages.
On the second day, he wrote twice that amount, which is 2 x 25 = 50 pages.
On the third day, he wrote twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 x 50 = 100 pages.
On the fourth day, he wrote 10 pages.

The total number of pages Cyrus has written so far is:
25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages.

Since Cyrus needs to write a total of 500 pages, he needs to write:
500 - 185 = 315 more pages.
