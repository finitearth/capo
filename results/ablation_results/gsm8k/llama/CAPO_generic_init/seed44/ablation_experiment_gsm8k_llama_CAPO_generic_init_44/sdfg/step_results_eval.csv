Input:
Marcy uses 6 ounces of pet cleaner to clean up a dog stain, 4 ounces to clean up a cat stain, and 1 ounce to clean up a rabbit stain. How much cleaner does she need to clean up after 6 dogs, 3 cats and 1 rabbit?
Output:
To find out how much cleaner Marcy needs, we need to calculate the amount of cleaner needed for each type of animal and then add them together.

For 6 dogs: 6 dogs * 6 ounces/dog = 36 ounces
For 3 cats: 3 cats * 4 ounces/cat = 12 ounces
For 1 rabbit: 1 rabbit * 1 ounce/rabbit = 1 ounce

Now, let's add up the total amount of cleaner needed: 36 ounces + 12 ounces + 1 ounce = 49 ounces

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 halves.
2. He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 quarters.
3. He cuts each quarter in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:
8 - 7 = 1

Jimmy's father receives 20 emails a day. Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day to his email. What's the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month?
Output:
To find the total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April, we need to calculate the number of emails he received before and after subscribing to the news channel.

April has 30 days. Since Jimmy's father subscribed to the news channel halfway through April, he subscribed on the 15th of April (30 / 2 = 15).

Before subscribing (from April 1 to April 15), Jimmy's father received 20 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 20 = 300 emails

After subscribing (from April 16 to April 30), Jimmy's father received 20 + 5 = 25 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 25 = 375 emails

The total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April is:
300 + 375 = 675 emails

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

Mrs. Gableâ€™s third grade class is on a field trip to the beach. For lunch, Mrs. Gable brought 20 lunches for the 20 students in her class. She included a pack of animal crackers in each lunch bag for dessert. Each pack of animal crackers contained 10 animal crackers. If 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, how many animal crackers were eaten in total among Mrs. Gableâ€™s students?
Output:
To find the total number of animal crackers eaten, we first need to determine the total number of animal crackers brought by Mrs. Gable. Since there were 20 lunches and each lunch included a pack of 10 animal crackers, the total number of animal crackers is 20 * 10 = 200.

However, 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, which means 2 packs of animal crackers were not eaten. Since each pack contains 10 animal crackers, the number of animal crackers not eaten is 2 * 10 = 20.

To find the total number of animal crackers eaten, we subtract the number of animal crackers not eaten from the total number of animal crackers: 200 - 20 = 180.

Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output:
To find out how many cucumbers will be used, let's denote the number of cucumbers as C and the number of tomatoes as T. We know the following:

1. The total number of vegetables (cucumbers + tomatoes) is 280.
   So, C + T = 280.

2. There are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers.
   So, T = 3C.

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:
C + 3C = 280
Which simplifies to:
4C = 280

Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
C = 280 / 4
C = 70

Therefore, the number of cucumbers that will be used in the salad is 70.

To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 halves.
2. He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 quarters.
3. He cuts each quarter in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:
8 - 7 = 1

Output:
To find out how much cleaner Marcy needs, we need to calculate the amount of cleaner needed for each type of animal and then add them together.

For 6 dogs: 6 dogs * 6 ounces/dog = 36 ounces
For 3 cats: 3 cats * 4 ounces/cat = 12 ounces
For 1 rabbit: 1 rabbit * 1 ounce/rabbit = 1 ounce

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

Input:
Mrs. Gableâ€™s third grade class is on a field trip to the beach. For lunch, Mrs. Gable brought 20 lunches for the 20 students in her class. She included a pack of animal crackers in each lunch bag for dessert. Each pack of animal crackers contained 10 animal crackers. If 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, how many animal crackers were eaten in total among Mrs. Gableâ€™s students?
Output:
To find the total number of animal crackers eaten, we first need to determine the total number of animal crackers brought by Mrs. Gable. Since there were 20 lunches and each lunch included a pack of 10 animal crackers, the total number of animal crackers is 20 * 10 = 200.

However, 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, which means 2 packs of animal crackers were not eaten. Since each pack contains 10 animal crackers, the number of animal crackers not eaten is 2 * 10 = 20.

To find the total number of animal crackers eaten, we subtract the number of animal crackers not eaten from the total number of animal crackers: 200 - 20 = 180.

Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output:
To find out how many cucumbers will be used, let's denote the number of cucumbers as C and the number of tomatoes as T. We know the following:

1. The total number of vegetables (cucumbers + tomatoes) is 280.
   So, C + T = 280.

2. There are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers.
   So, T = 3C.

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:
C + 3C = 280
Which simplifies to:
4C = 280

Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
C = 280 / 4
C = 70

Therefore, the number of cucumbers that will be used in the salad is 70.

Jimmy's father receives 20 emails a day. Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day to his email. What's the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month?
Output:
To find the total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April, we need to calculate the number of emails he received before and after subscribing to the news channel.

April has 30 days. Since Jimmy's father subscribed to the news channel halfway through April, he subscribed on the 15th of April (30 / 2 = 15).

Before subscribing (from April 1 to April 15), Jimmy's father received 20 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 20 = 300 emails

After subscribing (from April 16 to April 30), Jimmy's father received 20 + 5 = 25 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 25 = 375 emails

The total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April is:

Marcy uses 6 ounces of pet cleaner to clean up a dog stain, 4 ounces to clean up a cat stain, and 1 ounce to clean up a rabbit stain. How much cleaner does she need to clean up after 6 dogs, 3 cats and 1 rabbit?
Output:
To find out how much cleaner Marcy needs, we need to calculate the amount of cleaner needed for each type of animal and then add them together.

For 6 dogs: 6 dogs * 6 ounces/dog = 36 ounces
For 3 cats: 3 cats * 4 ounces/cat = 12 ounces
For 1 rabbit: 1 rabbit * 1 ounce/rabbit = 1 ounce

Now, let's add up the total amount of cleaner needed: 36 ounces + 12 ounces + 1 ounce = 49 ounces

Input:
Mrs. Gableâ€™s third grade class is on a field trip to the beach. For lunch, Mrs. Gable brought 20 lunches for the 20 students in her class. She included a pack of animal crackers in each lunch bag for dessert. Each pack of animal crackers contained 10 animal crackers. If 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, how many animal crackers were eaten in total among Mrs. Gableâ€™s students?
Output:
To find the total number of animal crackers eaten, we first need to determine the total number of animal crackers brought by Mrs. Gable. Since there were 20 lunches and each lunch included a pack of 10 animal crackers, the total number of animal crackers is 20 * 10 = 200.

However, 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, which means 2 packs of animal crackers were not eaten. Since each pack contains 10 animal crackers, the number of animal crackers not eaten is 2 * 10 = 20.

To find the total number of animal crackers eaten, we subtract the number of animal crackers not eaten from the total number of animal crackers: 200 - 20 = 180.

Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output:
To find out how many cucumbers will be used, let's denote the number of cucumbers as C and the number of tomatoes as T. We know the following:

1. The total number of vegetables (cucumbers + tomatoes) is 280.
   So, C + T = 280.

2. There are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers.
   So, T = 3C.

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:
C + 3C = 280
Which simplifies to:
4C = 280

Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
C = 280 / 4
C = 70

Therefore, the number of cucumbers that will be used in the salad is 70.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 halves.
2. He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 quarters.
3. He cuts each quarter in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Jimmy's father receives 20 emails a day. Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day to his email. What's the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month?
Output:
To find the total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April, we need to calculate the number of emails he received before and after subscribing to the news channel.

April has 30 days. Since Jimmy's father subscribed to the news channel halfway through April, he subscribed on the 15th of April (30 / 2 = 15).

Before subscribing (from April 1 to April 15), Jimmy's father received 20 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 20 = 300 emails

After subscribing (from April 16 to April 30), Jimmy's father received 20 + 5 = 25 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 25 = 375 emails

The total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April is:

2. He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 quarters.
3. He cuts each quarter in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:
8 - 7 = 1

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

Mrs. Gableâ€™s third grade class is on a field trip to the beach. For lunch, Mrs. Gable brought 20 lunches for the 20 students in her class. She included a pack of animal crackers in each lunch bag for dessert. Each pack of animal crackers contained 10 animal crackers. If 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, how many animal crackers were eaten in total among Mrs. Gableâ€™s students?
Output:
To find the total number of animal crackers eaten, we first need to determine the total number of animal crackers brought by Mrs. Gable. Since there were 20 lunches and each lunch included a pack of 10 animal crackers, the total number of animal crackers is 20 * 10 = 200.

However, 2 students did not eat their animal crackers, which means 2 packs of animal crackers were not eaten. Since each pack contains 10 animal crackers, the number of animal crackers not eaten is 2 * 10 = 20.

To find the total number of animal crackers eaten, we subtract the number of animal crackers not eaten from the total number of animal crackers: 200 - 20 = 180.

Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output:
To find out how many cucumbers will be used, let's denote the number of cucumbers as C and the number of tomatoes as T. We know the following:

1. The total number of vegetables (cucumbers + tomatoes) is 280.
   So, C + T = 280.

2. There are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers.
   So, T = 3C.

Substituting the second equation into the first, we get:
C + 3C = 280
Which simplifies to:
4C = 280

Dividing both sides by 4 gives:
C = 280 / 4
C = 70

Therefore, the number of cucumbers that will be used in the salad is 70.

Jimmy's father receives 20 emails a day. Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day to his email. What's the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month?
Output:
To find the total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April, we need to calculate the number of emails he received before and after subscribing to the news channel.

April has 30 days. Since Jimmy's father subscribed to the news channel halfway through April, he subscribed on the 15th of April (30 / 2 = 15).

Before subscribing (from April 1 to April 15), Jimmy's father received 20 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 20 = 300 emails

After subscribing (from April 16 to April 30), Jimmy's father received 20 + 5 = 25 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 25 = 375 emails

The total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April is:

Output:
To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

Jimmy's father receives 20 emails a day. Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day to his email. What's the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month?
Output:
To find the total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April, we need to calculate the number of emails he received before and after subscribing to the news channel.

April has 30 days. Since Jimmy's father subscribed to the news channel halfway through April, he subscribed on the 15th of April (30 / 2 = 15).

Before subscribing (from April 1 to April 15), Jimmy's father received 20 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 20 = 300 emails

After subscribing (from April 16 to April 30), Jimmy's father received 20 + 5 = 25 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 25 = 375 emails

The total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April is:
300 + 375 = 675 emails

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 halves.
2. He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 quarters.
3. He cuts each quarter in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:
8 - 7 = 1

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:
8 - 7 = 1

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

Jimmy's father receives 20 emails a day. Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day to his email. What's the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month?
Output:
To find the total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April, we need to calculate the number of emails he received before and after subscribing to the news channel.

April has 30 days. Since Jimmy's father subscribed to the news channel halfway through April, he subscribed on the 15th of April (30 / 2 = 15).

Before subscribing (from April 1 to April 15), Jimmy's father received 20 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 20 = 300 emails

After subscribing (from April 16 to April 30), Jimmy's father received 20 + 5 = 25 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:

Input:
Jimmy's father receives 20 emails a day. Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day to his email. What's the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month?
Output:
To find the total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April, we need to calculate the number of emails he received before and after subscribing to the news channel.

April has 30 days. Since Jimmy's father subscribed to the news channel halfway through April, he subscribed on the 15th of April (30 / 2 = 15).

Before subscribing (from April 1 to April 15), Jimmy's father received 20 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 20 = 300 emails

After subscribing (from April 16 to April 30), Jimmy's father received 20 + 5 = 25 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 25 = 375 emails

The total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April is:
300 + 375 = 675 emails

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 halves.
2. He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 quarters.
3. He cuts each quarter in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:

Input:
Jimmy's father receives 20 emails a day. Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day to his email. What's the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month?
Output:
To find the total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April, we need to calculate the number of emails he received before and after subscribing to the news channel.

April has 30 days. Since Jimmy's father subscribed to the news channel halfway through April, he subscribed on the 15th of April (30 / 2 = 15).

Before subscribing (from April 1 to April 15), Jimmy's father received 20 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 20 = 300 emails

After subscribing (from April 16 to April 30), Jimmy's father received 20 + 5 = 25 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 25 = 375 emails

The total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April is:
300 + 375 = 675 emails

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

2. He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 quarters.
3. He cuts each quarter in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:
8 - 7 = 1

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 halves.
2. He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 quarters.
3. He cuts each quarter in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:
8 - 7 = 1

2. He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 quarters.
3. He cuts each quarter in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:
8 - 7 = 1

Jimmy's father receives 20 emails a day. Halfway through April, he subscribed to a news channel that sent 5 more emails per day to his email. What's the total number of emails Jimmy's father had at the end of the month?
Output:
To find the total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April, we need to calculate the number of emails he received before and after subscribing to the news channel.

April has 30 days. Since Jimmy's father subscribed to the news channel halfway through April, he subscribed on the 15th of April (30 / 2 = 15).

Before subscribing (from April 1 to April 15), Jimmy's father received 20 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 20 = 300 emails

After subscribing (from April 16 to April 30), Jimmy's father received 20 + 5 = 25 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 25 = 375 emails

The total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April is:
300 + 375 = 675 emails

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 halves.
2. He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 quarters.
3. He cuts each quarter in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:
8 - 7 = 1

- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:
8 - 7 = 1

Before subscribing (from April 1 to April 15), Jimmy's father received 20 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 20 = 300 emails

After subscribing (from April 16 to April 30), Jimmy's father received 20 + 5 = 25 emails per day. For 15 days, he received:
15 * 25 = 375 emails

The total number of emails Jimmy's father received in April is:
300 + 375 = 675 emails

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To determine the total number of cases Mark needs, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then sum them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 halves.
2. He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 quarters.
3. He cuts each quarter in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

Now, Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 friends = 3 slices
- 2 slices to 2 friends = 4 slices

In total, Phill gives out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

Phill started with 8 slices and gave out 7, so to find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given out from the total number of slices:
8 - 7 = 1
