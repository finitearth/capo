The terror attacks, it was clear, had blasted a hole in the dam holding back Mumbai's reservoir of woes. While the protesters seemed to be reacting to a tragedy that had left at least 164 people dead and 308 injured, they were really venting the frustrations of having to cope with life in a city with an infrastructure so stretched that simply getting to work and back is an ordeal.

The terror attacks, it was clear, had blasted a hole in the dam holding back Mumbai's reservoir of woes. While the protesters seemed to be reacting to a tragedy that had left at least 164 people dead and 308 injured, they were really venting the frustrations of having to cope with life in a city with an infrastructure so stretched that simply getting to work and back is an ordeal. At peak hour, the commuter trains - which carry six million people each day - are packed with up to 5,000 commuters, even though they're built for 1,800. Every day, an average of 11 people die on the railway system, either because they fall off the trains or because they're hit by passing locomotives as they cross the tracks.

Your goal is to evaluate whether the conclusion is a guaranteed truth if the premise is true. Essentially, you are determining if the information in the first sentence inherently implies the truth of the second sentence. If the second sentence logically and necessarily follows from the first, then the pair should be classified as 'Entailment'. However, if the second sentence's truth is not a direct consequence of the first sentence, it should be categorized as 'no entailment'. Your response should be either <final_answer>Entailment</final_answer> if the second sentence is a logical outcome of the first or <final_answer>no entailment</final_answer> if it is not, indicating whether the conclusion directly follows from the premise.
