A former federal health official arrested in the Virginia Fontaine Addictions Foundation scandal has been fined $107,000 for tax evasion. Patrick Nottingham, 57, was also sentenced to 18 months house arrest and ordered to complete 150 hours of community service work. The fine represents 50% of the federal income tax Nottingham did not pay on nearly $700,000 in kickbacks he received in return for approving excessive funding to the foundation in 1999 and 2000.  In November 2005, Nottingham pleaded guilty to fraud and influence peddling and received a conditional sentence of two years less a day. ""Mr. Nottingham was not only involved in fraudulent activity, he compounded that offence by not reporting that income,"" said Crown attorney Michael Foote at a sentencing hearing earlier this week. ""He effectively committed two sets of extraordinarily serious offences.""  Nottingham's fine is the minimum allowed by law. Foote said there is little expectation Nottingham will ever pay off the fine.

A former federal health official arrested in the Virginia Fontaine Addictions Foundation scandal has been fined $107,000 for tax evasion. Patrick Nottingham, 57, was also sentenced to 18 months house arrest and ordered to complete 150 hours of community service work. The fine represents 50% of the federal income tax Nottingham did not pay on nearly $700,000 in kickbacks he received in return for approving excessive funding to the foundation in 1999 and 2000.  In November 2005, Nottingham pleaded guilty to fraud and influence peddling and received a conditional sentence of two years less a day. ""Mr. Nottingham was not only involved in fraudulent activity, he compounded that offence by not reporting that income,"" said Crown attorney Michael Foote at a sentencing hearing earlier this week. ""He effectively committed two sets of extraordinarily serious offences.""  Nottingham's fine is the minimum allowed by law. Foote said there is little expectation Nottingham will ever pay off the fine.
