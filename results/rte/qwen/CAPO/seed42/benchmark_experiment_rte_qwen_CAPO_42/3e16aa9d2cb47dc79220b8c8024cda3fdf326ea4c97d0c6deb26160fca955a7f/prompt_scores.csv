Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer. The government will also provide an additional 800 officers to combat organised crime and another 1,248 staff to tackle domestic violence, Rubalcaba said.

Tuesday, famed ocean liner, Queen Elizabeth 2, popularly known as the QE2, arrived in her home port of Southampton, England for the final time. The Cunard Line ship has been in service since 1969, and is to become a floating hotel in Dubai. The homecoming was marred as the vessel ran aground on a sandbank near Calshot at the mouth of Southampton Water. The ship hit the sandbank at around 0530 GMT, and five tugs took around 30 minutes to pull the QE2 clear. The 70,000 tonne vessel was towed into port and eventually docked at 0730 GMT according to the Solent coastguard. Around a thousand crew and 1,700 passengers were aboard the ship, which was returning from a cruise around the Mediterranean.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer.

At least four people have been confirmed dead and insecurity in the region is forcing residents to flee the villages of Tore Wandi, Moba, Bangolo, Ledinwa and Garia for the relative safety of Mundri.

SEATTLE - Apple Inc., maker of Macintosh computers and the iPhone, reports fiscal second-quarter earnings Wednesday after the closing bell. The following is a summary of key developments related to that period. OVERVIEW: In January, Apple founder Steve Jobs addressed the matter of his increasingly gaunt appearance — twice. He first said it was caused by an easily treatable hormone imbalance, and that he would remain at the helm.

Chief Operating Officer Tim Cook is running the company in his absence.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer. The government will also provide an additional 800 officers to combat organised crime and another 1,248 staff to tackle domestic violence, Rubalcaba said.

Critics say last year's massive election victory was marred by fraud and corruption and that the pope must beware of allowing his visit, sponsored by the state, to be seen as legitimizing an authoritarian regime. The bishops in Angola twice have denounced the government for leaving its people mired in poverty while leaders enrich themselves off oil and diamonds.  Since he arrived on Friday from Cameroon, the pope has met with dos Santos and spoken out against corruption in Africa, the continent with the fastest-growing Catholic population in the world.

Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found in a sandstone formation in Montana. MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science. Results similar to the popular film ""Jurassic park"" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. ""Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female."", paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.

Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found in a sandstone formation in Montana. MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science. Results similar to the popular film ""Jurassic park"" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. ""Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female."", paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.

Spain will recruit 500 extra police to fight Basque separatists ETA and Islamist militants in the next four years, Interior Minister Alfredo Perez Rubalcaba said on Tuesday. Including the new recruits, the number of anti-terrorism officers will have increased by 1,800 since the Socialist government took office in 2004, days after Islamist militants killed 191 people by bombing Madrid trains, Rubalcaba told a parliamentary committee. ETA has killed more than 800 people in four decades in its fight for an independent Basque Country composed of part of northern Spain and southern France. Its last fatal attack came on May 14, authorities believe, when a car bomb wrecked a police barracks in the Spanish Basque Country, killing one officer.

Scientists have uncovered soft bone tissue of a Tyrannosaurus Rex known as MOR 1125, found in a sandstone formation in Montana. MOR 1125 was 18 years old when it died, 65 million years ago. Similar tissue of a dinosaur has never been found before, as all remains found until now were fosilized. The tissue still contains microscopic structures resembling bloodvessels and cells. The comparison between the structures found in the T-rex and a modern day Ostrich shows a remarkable similarity. The results have been duplicated with an 80-million-year-old hadrosaur and two other tyrannosaurs. The discovery was reported in today's issue of Science. Results similar to the popular film ""Jurassic park"" are unlikely, as the recovery of DNA from the tissue is improbable. The results remain astounding, however, and tests with antibodies that react to collagen shows the tissue may still contain proteins. ""Ultimately if we could establish chemical composition, we would have insights into all kinds of things: diet, sexual maturity, whether the specimen is the male or female."", paleontologist Hans-Dieter Sues said.

Sweden has plans to open a virtual embassy in Second Life, the virtual world home to thousands of netizens. Companies like Dell are already selling computers via the virtual world, but Sweden would become the first country to have a cyber-embassy in Second Life. The embassy would not provide visa or perform diplomatic tasks, but would provide information on how and where to get these documents in the real world, as well as giving cultural and tourist information about the country. Visitors will also be able to chat with embassy personnel. A spokesperson explained that it would be an easy and cheap way to reach young people. The idea came from The Swedish Institute, an agency of the Foreign Affairs Ministry of Sweden with providing information about Sweden as a key purpose. The ""House of Sweden"" as it will be called, will be modelled on the new Swedish embassy in Washington with the same name. The opening is expected in a few weeks. Second life has over 3 million registered accounts. On an average day, the maximum of people logged in at the same time peaks at 25,000. In September 2006, Second Life was reported to have a gross domestic product of $64 million. Some schools in the United States and Canada have virtual classrooms on the site. People like Ailin Graef a.k.a. Anshe Chung have developed virtual businesses in Second Life, and earn thousands of real dollars there.
