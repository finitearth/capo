A former federal health official arrested in the Virginia Fontaine Addictions Foundation scandal has been fined $107,000 for tax evasion. Patrick Nottingham, 57, was also sentenced to 18 months house arrest and ordered to complete 150 hours of community service work. The fine represents 50% of the federal income tax Nottingham did not pay on nearly $700,000 in kickbacks he received in return for approving excessive funding to the foundation in 1999 and 2000.  In November 2005, Nottingham pleaded guilty to fraud and influence peddling and received a conditional sentence of two years less a day. ""Mr. Nottingham was not only involved in fraudulent activity, he compounded that offence by not reporting that income,"" said Crown attorney Michael Foote at a sentencing hearing earlier this week. ""He effectively committed two sets of extraordinarily serious offences.""  Nottingham's fine is the minimum allowed by law.

A former federal health official arrested in the Virginia Fontaine Addictions Foundation scandal has been fined $107,000 for tax evasion. Patrick Nottingham, 57, was also sentenced to 18 months house arrest and ordered to complete 150 hours of community service work. The fine represents 50% of the federal income tax Nottingham did not pay on nearly $700,000 in kickbacks he received in return for approving excessive funding to the foundation in 1999 and 2000.  In November 2005, Nottingham pleaded guilty to fraud and influence peddling and received a conditional sentence of two years less a day. ""Mr. Nottingham was not only involved in fraudulent activity, he compounded that offence by not reporting that income,"" said Crown attorney Michael Foote at a sentencing hearing earlier this week. ""He effectively committed two sets of extraordinarily serious offences.""  Nottingham's fine is the minimum allowed by law. Foote said there is little expectation Nottingham will ever pay off the fine.

A former federal health official arrested in the Virginia Fontaine Addictions Foundation scandal has been fined $107,000 for tax evasion. Patrick Nottingham, 57, was also sentenced to 18 months house arrest and ordered to complete 150 hours of community service work. The fine represents 50% of the federal income tax Nottingham did not pay on nearly $700,000 in kickbacks he received in return for approving excessive funding to the foundation in 1999 and 2000.  In November 2005, Nottingham pleaded guilty to fraud and influence peddling and received a conditional sentence of two years less a day. ""Mr. Nottingham was not only involved in fraudulent activity, he compounded that offence by not reporting that income,"" said Crown attorney Michael Foote at a sentencing hearing earlier this week. ""He effectively committed two sets of extraordinarily serious offences.""  Nottingham's fine is the minimum allowed by law. Foote said there is little expectation Nottingham will ever pay off the fine.

A former federal health official arrested in the Virginia Fontaine Addictions Foundation scandal has been fined $107,000 for tax evasion. Patrick Nottingham, 57, was also sentenced to 18 months house arrest and ordered to complete 150 hours of community service work. The fine represents 50% of the federal income tax Nottingham did not pay on nearly $700,000 in kickbacks he received in return for approving excessive funding to the foundation in 1999 and 2000.  In November 2005, Nottingham pleaded guilty to fraud and influence peddling and received a conditional sentence of two years less a day. ""Mr. Nottingham was not only involved in fraudulent activity, he compounded that offence by not reporting that income,"" said Crown attorney Michael Foote at a sentencing hearing earlier this week. ""He effectively committed two sets of extraordinarily serious offences.""  Nottingham's fine is the minimum allowed by law.

The terror attacks, it was clear, had blasted a hole in the dam holding back Mumbai's reservoir of woes. While the protesters seemed to be reacting to a tragedy that had left at least 164 people dead and 308 injured, they were really venting the frustrations of having to cope with life in a city with an infrastructure so stretched that simply getting to work and back is an ordeal. At peak hour, the commuter trains - which carry six million people each day - are packed with up to 5,000 commuters, even though they're built for 1,800. Every day, an average of 11 people die on the railway system, either because they fall off the trains or because they're hit by passing locomotives as they cross the tracks.

THE Government wants Nigerian mother-of-two Pamela Izevbekhai's case to stay in this country struck out after revelations that documents used in her action were forged. Ms Izevbekhai has been to the High Court 22 times to prevent her family's deportation on the grounds that her two daughters Naomi (7) and Jemima (6) will be subjected to female genital mutilation (FGM). However, she admitted last weekend that some documents given to the courts were forged. She has stood over her claim that she had a baby daughter, Elizabeth, who died from blood loss as a result of FGM. If her case is struck out, she and her daughters face deportation back to Nigeria.

Any taxpayer earning over £150,000 will no longer enjoy higher-rate tax relief, which is considered a substantial incentive to save for wealthy workers. From April 2011, anyone who earns £200,000 a year, for example, and pays the typical amount of 6 per cent of their salary into their company pension scheme will lose out on £200 a month or £2,400 a year.  Alistair Darling, when he announced the move in the Budget, insisted that just 1.5 per cent of taxpayers - the equivalent of about 450,000 people - would be hit, but experts argued that it would significantly damage the already beleaguered pensions industry, and cause many savers to think twice about investing in a pension.

Any taxpayer earning over £150,000 will no longer enjoy higher-rate tax relief, which is considered a substantial incentive to save for wealthy workers. From April 2011, anyone who earns £200,000 a year, for example, and pays the typical amount of 6 per cent of their salary into their company pension scheme will lose out on £200 a month or £2,400 a year.  Alistair Darling, when he announced the move in the Budget, insisted that just 1.5 per cent of taxpayers - the equivalent of about 450,000 people - would be hit, but experts argued that it would significantly damage the already beleaguered pensions industry, and cause many savers to think twice about investing in a pension.
