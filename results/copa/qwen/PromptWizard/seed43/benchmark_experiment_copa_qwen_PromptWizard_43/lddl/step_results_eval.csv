The task involves analyzing a premise and two possible choices to determine the most logical effect of the premise. The premise will be presented, followed by two options labeled A and B. Your job is to select the option that logically follows as the effect of the premise. Provide your answer strictly in the format <final_answer>A</final_answer> or <final_answer>B</final_answer>. Ensure your choice is based on the most plausible and direct relationship to the premise. If neither option seems to be a clear effect, choose the one that is less contradictory to the premise or more commonly associated with the premise.

Example:
Premise: The sky is dark.
A: It is raining.
B: The sun is shining.
<final_answer>A</final_answer>

Note: In cases where both options are not directly caused by the premise, choose the one that is less contradictory or more commonly associated with the premise. For example, if the premise is ""The ground is wet,"" and the options are ""It rained"" and ""The sprinklers are on,"" choose the one that is more commonly associated with the premise.
