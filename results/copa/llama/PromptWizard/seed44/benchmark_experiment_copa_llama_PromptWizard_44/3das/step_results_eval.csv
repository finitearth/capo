[Question] A new educational policy was implemented to increase the use of digital resources in classrooms.
effect A: The school's budget for textbooks decreased.
effect B: The number of teachers hired increased significantly.
[Answer] To determine the correct effect of the premise, we follow a logical pathway that analyzes the relationship between the premise and the given options. Here's the step-by-step reasoning chain:

1. **Understanding the Premise**: The premise states that a new educational policy was implemented to increase the use of digital resources in classrooms. This implies a shift towards digital materials and potentially away from traditional teaching methods or resources.

2. **Analyzing Option A**: Option A suggests that the school's budget for textbooks decreased. Given the policy's focus on increasing the use of digital resources, it is logical to assume that the need for traditional textbooks would decrease. A decrease in the budget for textbooks would be a direct consequence of this policy, as schools would likely allocate less money to textbooks and more to digital resources.

3. **Analyzing Option B**: Option B proposes that the number of teachers hired increased significantly. While the hiring of teachers could be influenced by various factors, including policy changes, the direct relationship between hiring more teachers and the policy to increase digital resource usage is not as clear-cut. The policy specifically mentions digital resources, not staffing changes.

4. **Comparing Logical Consequences**: 
    - **Option A** directly aligns with the policy's objective. If schools are using more <ANS_START>The policy aims to increase the use of digital resources, which would likely reduce the need for traditional textbooks. Decreasing the budget for textbooks (effect A) would be a logical consequence as it would reflect the shift towards digital materials. On the other hand, increasing the number of teachers hired (effect B) does not directly relate to the policy's focus on digital resources. Therefore, the correct effect is A, as it aligns with the policy's objective of increasing digital resource usage. <ANS_START>A<ANS_END><ANS_END>
