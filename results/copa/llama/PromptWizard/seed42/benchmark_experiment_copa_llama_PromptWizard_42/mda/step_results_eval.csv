This goal is crucial in understanding the potential effects of the new hire, as it sets the direction for the strategies and actions the specialist will undertake.

3. **Evaluating Option A**: Option A states that the company's engagement on Twitter increased significantly. Given the role of a social media specialist, this outcome is highly plausible. Social media specialists are trained to understand audience behavior, create engaging content, and use platforms' features to increase interaction with the brand. Twitter, being a key platform for real-time engagement, is likely to be a focus area for such strategies.
