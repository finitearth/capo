2. However, the latter part of the sentence, ""but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go,"" indicates a lack of direction or coherence in the film, which is a negative point.

Input: such a premise is ripe for all manner of lunacy , but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentiment of the movie review:

1. The phrase ""ripe for all manner of lunacy"" suggests potential for creativity or chaos, which could be seen as positive or negative depending on the execution.
2. However, the latter part of the sentence, ""but kaufman and gondry rarely seem sure of where it should go,"" indicates a lack of direction or coherence in the film, which is a negative point.

Given the overall tone of the review, it seems to lean more towards a negative sentiment due to the criticism of the filmmakers' direction.

<final_answer>negative</final_answer>

Input: if swimfan does catch on , it may be because teens are looking for something to make them laugh .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentiment of the movie review:

1. The review suggests that the movie ""Swimfan"" may become popular among teens.
2. However, the reason given for its potential popularity is that teens are looking for something to make them laugh, implying that the movie might not have other substantial qualities.
3. The use of ""may"" indicates uncertainty about the movie's success.
4. The overall tone is not enthusiastic or positive about the movie's quality or appeal beyond its potential to make teens laugh.

Considering these points, the sentiment seems to be slightly negative, as it implies that the movie's only merit might be its ability to make teens laugh, without suggesting any other positive qualities.

Output: user
<final_answer>neutral</final_answer>

Input: occasionally loud and offensive , but more often , it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma .
Output: user
To determine the sentiment of this movie review, let's break it down:

1. ""occasionally loud and offensive"" - This part of the review suggests a negative sentiment, as the words ""loud"" and ""offensive"" are generally not positive descriptors.

2. ""but more often, it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma"" - This part of the review suggests a neutral to slightly negative sentiment. The phrase ""gentle waking coma"" implies that the movie is not engaging or exciting, which is not a positive attribute for a film.

Considering both parts of the review, the overall sentiment seems to lean towards a negative or neutral side. However, since the negative aspects are more prominent, the sentiment is more likely to be negative rather than neutral.

To determine the sentiment of the movie review, let's break it down:

1. ""a completely spooky piece of business"" - This phrase suggests that the movie is scary and intense, which can be seen as a positive attribute for a horror or thriller movie.
2. ""that gets under your skin"" - This indicates that the movie is effective in creating an emotional impact on the viewer, which is generally a positive sentiment.
3. ""some plot blips aside"" - This suggests that there are some minor issues with the plot, which could slightly detract from the overall enjoyment of the movie.
4. ""stays there for the duration"" - This implies that the movie maintains its impact throughout, which is a positive aspect.

Considering these points, the review seems to be mostly positive, with a minor critique about the plot. The overall sentiment leans towards a positive experience, despite the small plot issues mentioned.
