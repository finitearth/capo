To analyze the emotional undertones of the provided movie review, let's break down the key words and phrases:

- ""impeccable"": This word suggests something is done perfectly or flawlessly, which is generally a positive term.
- ""study in perversity"": This phrase is more complex. ""Perversity"" typically refers to behavior that is deliberately deviant or morally wrong. However, in the context of a movie review, it could mean that the movie is a well-executed exploration of deviant or morally complex themes.

Input: like an afterschool special with costumes by gianni versace , mad love looks better than it feels .
Output: user
The review suggests a mixed sentiment but leans more towards a negative tone. The phrase ""looks better than it feels"" implies that while the visual aspects (costumes by Gianni Versace) might be appealing, the overall experience or content of the movie is not particularly satisfying or enjoyable.

<final_answer>negative</final_answer>

Input: paid in full is remarkably engaging despite being noticeably derivative of goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks .
Output: user
To analyze the sentiment of the given movie review, let's break it down:

1. ""remarkably engaging"" - This phrase suggests a positive sentiment, indicating that the movie is captivating and interesting.
2. ""despite being noticeably derivative"" - This part introduces a negative aspect, suggesting that the movie borrows heavily from other films, which is generally seen as a drawback.
3. ""goodfellas and at least a half dozen other trouble-in-the-ghetto flicks"" - This further emphasizes the derivative nature of the movie, reinforcing the negative sentiment.

Considering these points, the review acknowledges both positive and negative aspects of the movie. The positive sentiment comes from the movie being engaging, while the negative sentiment stems from its derivative nature. However, the positive aspect seems to outweigh the negative one, as the review starts with a strong positive statement and the negative aspects are presented as secondary.
