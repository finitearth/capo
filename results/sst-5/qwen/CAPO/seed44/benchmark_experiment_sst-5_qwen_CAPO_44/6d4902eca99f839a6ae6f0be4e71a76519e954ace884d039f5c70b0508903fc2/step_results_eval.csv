Input:
yes they can swim , the title is merely anne-sophie birot 's off-handed way of saying girls find adolescence difficult to wade through .
Output:
To determine the sentiment of the movie review, let's break down the analysis step by step:

1. **Identify Key Phrases and Tone:**
   - ""yes they can swim"" - This phrase is neutral and factual.
   - ""the title is merely anne-sophie birot's off-handed way"" - This suggests a casual or dismissive tone.
   - ""girls find adolescence difficult to wade through"" - This implies a challenging experience, which can be seen as slightly negative.

2. **Overall Impression:**
   - The review does not express strong positive or negative emotions. It seems to be more of an observational statement about the movie's theme.
   - The tone is somewhat casual and does not convey strong feelings either way.

3. **Sentiment Classification:**
   - Given the neutral and slightly observational tone, the sentiment is best classified as neutral.

Based on this analysis, the sentiment of the movie review is neutral.
