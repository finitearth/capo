Input: the work of an artist tormented by his heritage , using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims .
Output: user
To analyze the emotional tone of the provided movie review, let's break down the key phrases and their implications:

1. ""the work of an artist tormented by his heritage"" - This phrase suggests a deep emotional struggle and a sense of burden or pain, which could be seen as negative. However, it also implies a level of depth and authenticity in the artist's work, which can be viewed positively.

2. ""using his storytelling ability to honor the many faceless victims"" - This indicates a noble purpose and a respectful approach to storytelling, which is generally seen as positive. The term ""faceless victims"" suggests a focus on underrepresented or forgotten individuals, which can be seen as a commendable effort to bring attention to their stories.

Considering these elements, the review seems to lean towards a positive sentiment, as it acknowledges the artist's struggle but emphasizes the noble purpose and the depth of the storytelling. However, it does not contain extremely positive language or superlatives that would categorize it as ""very positive.""

Output: user
The review describes the movie as ""earnest and tentative even when it aims to shock."" This suggests a somewhat reserved or cautious approach to the film's content, indicating that the reviewer perceives the movie as trying to be shocking but not necessarily succeeding in doing so in a forceful or impactful way. The terms ""earnest"" and ""tentative"" lean towards a neutral to slightly positive sentiment, as they imply sincerity and carefulness rather than negativity. However, the overall tone does not express strong enthusiasm or approval, which would be necessary for a very positive categorization.

Based on the phrase ""spend your benjamins on a matinee,"" it seems like the reviewer is suggesting that the movie is worth seeing, especially if you can catch it at a cheaper price, like a matinee. However, the suggestion is not overwhelmingly enthusiastic, and there's no explicit praise or criticism.

Given the limited information, the safest categorization would be neutral.

Input: during the tuxedo 's 90 minutes of screen time , there is n't one true ` chan moment ' .
Output: user
The review for ""The Tuxedo"" indicates disappointment, particularly in the absence of characteristic ""chan moments"" which are likely expected comedic or action highlights associated with the star. The reviewer's sentiment is clearly not satisfied with the film, pointing out a significant lack of what they consider essential elements. This points towards a negative sentiment.

<final_answer>negative</final_answer>

Input: handsome and sincere but slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism .
Output: user
The review describes the movie as ""handsome and sincere"" which are positive attributes, but it also mentions that the movie is ""slightly awkward in its combination of entertainment and evangelical boosterism,"" which introduces a negative aspect. The use of ""slightly awkward"" suggests that while there are some issues, they are not severe enough to completely detract from the overall impression. 

Given the mixed nature of the feedback, with positive elements being acknowledged alongside some criticism, the sentiment leans more towards the middle of the spectrum. Therefore, the sentiment of this review can be categorized as neutral.

<final_answer>neutral</final_answer>

Input: for something as splendid-looking as this particular film , the viewer expects something special but instead gets -lrb- sci-fi -rrb- rehash .
Output: user
The review expresses disappointment with the film despite its visually appealing qualities. The expectation of something special was not met, and the reviewer seems to feel that the film is unoriginal, describing it as a ""rehash."" This indicates a letdown and dissatisfaction with the content of the film.

Given the disappointment and the use of words like ""rehash,"" which implies a lack of originality, the sentiment leans towards a negative view of the film. However, the acknowledgment of the film's visual appeal prevents it from being very negative.

<final_answer>negative</final_answer>

Input: an unusually dry-eyed , even analytical approach to material that is generally played for maximum moisture .
Output: user
The review seems to be pointing out an unconventional approach to a typically emotional subject matter. The use of ""unusually dry-eyed, even analytical"" suggests that the movie takes a more detached or intellectual approach rather than an emotional one. This isn't necessarily negative; it's more about the style of the film. The phrase ""played for maximum moisture"" implies that the movie could have been made to be more emotionally manipulative, but it chose not to be. This could be seen as a positive trait for viewers who prefer a more thoughtful or less sentimental approach to storytelling.

Given the context, the sentiment seems to lean towards a positive appreciation of the film's unique approach, even if it's not overtly praising the film's quality or emotional impact. Therefore, the sentiment can be categorized as positive.

Input: though tom shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
Output: user
Let's analyze the emotional content of the review:

1. The review starts with a somewhat neutral tone, acknowledging that the film ""kicks off spookily enough,"" which suggests that the beginning of the film is at least engaging or intriguing.
2. However, the reviewer then criticizes the film for taking ""an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance."" The use of ""glucose sentimentality"" implies that the film becomes overly sweet or emotionally manipulative, which is generally seen as a negative trait. The term ""laughable contrivance"" suggests that the plot or story elements are unrealistic or poorly constructed, which is also a negative assessment.

Given these points, the overall sentiment of the review is negative, as the criticism outweighs the initial neutral observation.

<final_answer>negative</final_answer>

Input: decent but dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the emotional content of the review ""decent but dull.""

The word ""decent"" suggests that the film meets a basic standard of quality, which is not negative but also not particularly positive. It implies a neutral to slightly positive sentiment.

However, the word ""dull"" carries a negative connotation, indicating that the film is uninteresting or boring.

Considering both words together, the review leans more towards a negative sentiment due to the use of ""dull,"" but it is not strongly negative because ""decent"" softens the overall tone.
