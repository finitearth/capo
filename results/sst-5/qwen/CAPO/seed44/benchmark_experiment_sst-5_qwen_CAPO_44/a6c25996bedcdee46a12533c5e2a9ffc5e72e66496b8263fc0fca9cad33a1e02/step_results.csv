Let's analyze the emotional content of the review:

1. The review starts with a somewhat neutral tone, acknowledging that the film ""kicks off spookily enough,"" which suggests that the beginning of the film is at least engaging or intriguing.
2. However, the reviewer then criticizes the film for taking ""an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance."" The use of ""glucose sentimentality"" implies that the film becomes overly sweet or emotionally manipulative, which is generally seen as a negative trait. The term ""laughable contrivance"" suggests that the plot or story elements are unrealistic or poorly constructed, which is also a negative assessment.

Given these points, the overall sentiment of the review is negative, as the criticism outweighs the initial neutral observation.

<final_answer>negative</final_answer>

Input: decent but dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the emotional content of the review ""decent but dull.""

The word ""decent"" suggests that the film meets a basic standard of quality, which is not negative but also not particularly positive. It implies a neutral to slightly positive sentiment.

However, the word ""dull"" carries a negative connotation, indicating that the film is uninteresting or boring.

Considering both words together, the review leans more towards a negative sentiment due to the use of ""dull,"" but it is not strongly negative because ""decent"" softens the overall tone.

Input: though tom shadyac 's film kicks off spookily enough , around the halfway mark it takes an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance .
Output: user
Let's analyze the emotional content of the review:

1. The review starts with a somewhat neutral tone, acknowledging that the film ""kicks off spookily enough,"" which suggests that the beginning of the film is at least engaging or intriguing.
2. However, the reviewer then criticizes the film for taking ""an abrupt turn into glucose sentimentality and laughable contrivance."" The use of ""glucose sentimentality"" implies that the film becomes overly sweet or emotionally manipulative, which is generally seen as a negative trait. The term ""laughable contrivance"" suggests that the plot or story elements are unrealistic or poorly constructed, which is also a negative assessment.

Given these points, the overall sentiment of the review is negative, as the criticism outweighs the initial neutral observation.

<final_answer>negative</final_answer>

Input: decent but dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the emotional content of the review ""decent but dull.""

The word ""decent"" suggests that the film meets a basic standard of quality, which is not negative but also not particularly positive. It implies a neutral to slightly positive sentiment.

However, the word ""dull"" carries a negative connotation, indicating that the film is uninteresting or boring.

Considering both words together, the review leans more towards a negative sentiment due to the use of ""dull,"" but it is not strongly negative because ""decent"" softens the overall tone.

To assess the emotional tone of the provided movie review, let's break down the key phrases and their implications:

1. ""an uncomfortable experience"" - This suggests a negative sentiment, as discomfort is generally not a positive feeling.
