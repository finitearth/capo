The dataset consists of movie reviews with five levels of sentiment labels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive. The task is to classify each movie review into one of these five sentiment categories. The class will be extracted between the markers <final_answer>answer</final_answer>.

To approach this task, consider the following steps:
1. Identify key words and phrases that indicate sentiment, such as ""skippable,"" ""hayseeds,"" and comparative terms like ""meets.""
2. Analyze the overall tone and implications of the review, considering the context and any sarcasm or irony.
3. Break down the review into components (subject matter, tone, implications) and analyze each for sentiment.
4. Combine the insights from the previous steps to determine the most appropriate sentiment category.

Apply these steps to the following film review and classify it into one of the five sentiment categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive. Your classification should be enclosed between <final_answer> and </final_answer> markers.
