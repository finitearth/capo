Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the emotional undertone of the given movie review, let's analyze the language and tone used. The review describes the movie as a ""slow-moving police-procedural thriller,"" which suggests that the pace of the movie might be a point of criticism, as ""slow-moving"" can imply boredom or lack of engagement. Additionally, the phrase ""takes its title all too literally"" could imply that the reviewer found the movie's adherence to its title to be overly simplistic or unimaginative, which further suggests a negative tone.

Given this analysis, the sentiment of the review would be classified as negative because it highlights what appears to be a significant drawback (the slow pace) and implies a lack of creativity in how the title's theme is explored.

Input: a slow-moving police-procedural thriller that takes its title all too literally .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the emotional undertone of the given movie review, let's analyze the language and tone used. The review describes the movie as a ""slow-moving police-procedural thriller,"" which suggests that the pace of the movie might be a point of criticism, as ""slow-moving"" can imply boredom or lack of engagement. Additionally, the phrase ""takes its title all too literally"" could imply that the reviewer found the movie's adherence to its title to be overly simplistic or unimaginative, which further suggests a negative tone.

Given this analysis, the sentiment of the review would be classified as negative because it highlights what appears to be a significant drawback (the slow pace) and implies a lack of creativity in how the title's theme is explored.
