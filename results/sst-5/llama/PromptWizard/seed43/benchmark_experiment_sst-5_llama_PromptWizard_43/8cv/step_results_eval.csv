1," To make progress on this sentiment analysis problem, let's simplify it by evaluating the sentiment of this film review, and by making a list of ideas for solving this problem, choose from: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, or very positive, and format your response with <final_answer> </final_answer>, and then assess the effectiveness of the approach. 


[Question] the movie is an absolute disaster, with a storyline that is both confusing and boring, and the acting is atrocious.
[Answer] To classify the sentiment of the given movie review, we will follow a step-by-step approach based on the language, tone, and content of the review. Here's the detailed reasoning chain:

1. **Identify Key Sentiment Indicators**: The first step is to identify words or phrases within the review that are known to carry strong sentiment, either positive or negative. In the given review, words like ""disaster,"" ""confusing,"" ""boring,"" and ""atrocious"" are significant indicators of negative sentiment.

2. **Assess the Intensity of Sentiment Indicators**: Next, we evaluate the intensity of these indicators. Words like ""disaster"" and ""atrocious"" are very strong negative terms. ""Disaster"" implies a complete failure, and ""atrocious"" suggests something is of very poor quality. The use of such strong language indicates a deep dissatisfaction.

3. **Analyze the Scope of Criticism**: We then analyze how widespread the criticism is. The review criticizes both the storyline (calling it ""confusing"" and ""boring"") and the acting (""atrocious""). This comprehensive criticism suggests that the reviewer found multiple fundamental aspects of the movie to be severely lacking, which reinforces the negative sentiment.

4. <ANS_START>The language used is very strong, with words like ""disaster"" and ""atrocious"", indicating a strong negative sentiment. The criticism is not just limited to the storyline but also extends to the acting, further emphasizing the negative opinion. The tone is harsh and dismissive, leaving no room for positive interpretation. Therefore, the sentiment of this review is <ANS_START>very negative<ANS_END>.<ANS_END>

For each question present the reasoning followed by the correct answer within <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.","You are a natural language processing (NLP) specialist with expertise in text classification and sentiment analysis. You have extensive experience in working with large datasets of text reviews and have developed a keen understanding of the nuances of language that convey sentiment. You are well-versed in machine learning algorithms and have a strong background in programming languages such as Python, which enables you to design and implement effective text classification models. Your expertise includes preprocessing text data, feature extraction, and model selection, as well as hyperparameter tuning to optimize model performance. You are familiar with popular NLP libraries and tools, such as NLTK, spaCy, and scikit-learn, and have hands-on experience with deep learning frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. With your expertise, you can develop a highly accurate text classification model that can effectively categorize movie reviews into one of the five sentiment categories: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive. You can extract the final answer, which is the predicted sentiment category, and format it between the markers <final_answer>answer</final_answer> for easy identification. Your ability to analyze and understand the complexities of human language makes you an ideal agent for this task.",19213,19717,0,0,0.304
