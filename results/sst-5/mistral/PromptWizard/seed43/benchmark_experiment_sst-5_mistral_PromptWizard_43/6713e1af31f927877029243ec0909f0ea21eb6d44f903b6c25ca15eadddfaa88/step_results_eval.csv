The dataset consists of movie reviews with five levels of sentiment labels: very negative, negative, neutral, positive, and very positive. The task is to classify each movie review into one of these five sentiment categories. The class will be extracted between the markers <final_answer>answer</final_answer>.

To solve the problem of classifying movie reviews into sentiment categories, we can design an experiment that involves several steps. First, we need to preprocess the data to clean and format it. This includes tokenization, removing stop words, handling punctuation, and normalizing the text. Then, we can use machine learning models to classify the sentiment of each review. We can measure progress by evaluating the accuracy of the model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1 score. To simplify the problem, we can start with a smaller dataset and gradually increase the complexity. The key assumptions underlying this problem are that the sentiment of a movie review can be accurately classified using machine learning models.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Tokenize the text into words.
    - Remove stop words (e.g., 'the"", ""and"", ""is"").
   


[Question] The movie's visual effects are stunning, but the story is weak and lacks depth. The characters are poorly developed, making the movie less engaging.
[Answer] To classify the sentiment of the movie review, we can follow a structured reasoning chain that involves several steps. Here is a detailed reasoning chain to arrive at the correct answer:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Tokenize the text**: Break the text into individual words.
     - ""The movie's visual effects are stunning, but the story is weak and lacks depth. The characters are poorly developed, making the movie less engaging.""
   - Tokenized words: [""The"", ""movie's"", ""visual"", ""effect"", ""are"", ""stunning"", ""but"", ""the"", ""story"", ""is"", ""weak"", ""and"", ""lack"", ""depth"", ""The"", ""characters"", ""are"", ""poorly"", ""developed"", ""making"", ""the"", ""movie"", ""less"", ""engaging""]

2. **Remove stop words**: Remove common words that do not contribute to the sentiment.
   - Remaining words: [""movie's"", ""visual"", ""effect"", ""stunning"", ""story"", ""weak"", ""depth"", ""characters"", ""poorly"", ""developed"", ""making"", ""movie"", ""less"", ""engaging""]

3. **Analyze the sentiment of the remaining words:
 <ANS_START>negative<ANS_END>

[Question] The movie has a compelling plot with well-developed characters, but the visual effects are lacking. The overall experience is enjoyable, but the visual aspects could be improved.
[Answer] To classify the sentiment of the movie review, we can follow a structured reasoning chain that involves several steps. Here is the detailed reasoning chain:

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Tokenize the text**: Break the text into individual words.
     - Example: ""The movie has a compelling plot with well-developed characters, but the visual effects are lacking. The overall experience is enjoyable, but the visual aspects could be improved.""
    - Tokenized: [""The"", ""movie"", ""has"", ""a"", ""compelling"", ""plot"", ""with"", ""well"", ""developed"", ""characters"", ""but"", ""the"", ""visual"", ""effect"", ""are"", ""lacking"", ""The"", ""overall"", ""experience"", ""is"", ""enjoyable"", ""but"", ""the"", ""visual"", ""aspect"", ""could"", ""be"", ""improved""]

2. **Remove stop words**: Remove common words that do not contribute to the sentiment.
    - Example: [""The"", ""movie"", ""has"", ""a"", ""compelling"", ""plot"", ""with"", ""well"", ""developed"", ""characters"", ""but"", ""the"", ""visual"", ""effect"", ""are <ANS_START>positive<ANS_END>
