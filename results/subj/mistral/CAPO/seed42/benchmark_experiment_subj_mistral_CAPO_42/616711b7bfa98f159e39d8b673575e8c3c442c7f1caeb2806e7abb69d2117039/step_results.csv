Input: often hilarious , well-shot and , importantly , entertaining , hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed .
Output: To determine whether the sentence conveates factual information or personal opinions/feelings, we need to analyze the content:

- ""often hilarious, well-shot, and importantly, entertaining""
- ""hell house is a fascinating document of an event that has to be seen to be believed""

The phrases ""often hilorous,"" ""well-shot,"" ""entertaining,"" and ""fascinating"" are subjective because they describe personal opinions and feelings. The phrase ""has to be seen to be believed"" is subjective as it conveates a personal opinion about the event.

Therefore, the sentence is subjective.
