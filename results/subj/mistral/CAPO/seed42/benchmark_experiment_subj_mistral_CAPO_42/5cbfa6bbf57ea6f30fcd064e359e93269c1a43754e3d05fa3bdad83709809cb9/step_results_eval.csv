Input:
suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative . still , as a visual treat , the film is almost unsurpassed .
Output:
To determine whether the given sentence is objective or subjective, we need to analyze the content and the tone of the sentence.

The sentence is:
""suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative. still, as a visual treat, the film is almost unsurpassed.""

### Analysis:
1. **Subjectivity**: The sentence expresses opinions and personal judgments. The phrases ""suffers from the lack of a compelling or comprehensible narrative"" and ""as a visual treat, the film is almost unsurpassed"" are subjective because they reflect personal opinions and judgments about the film.
2. **Objectivity**: The sentence does not provide factual information or objective data. It does not state facts or provide information without personal bias.

### Conclusion:
The sentence is subjective because it expresses opinions and personal judgments about the film.
