Using your understanding of subjectivity vs. objectivity in language, determine if the given sentence is objective or subjective. Subjective sentences often contain personal opinions, feelings, or judgments, while objective sentences are based on facts and verifiable information. Consider not only words that indicate bias or factual information, such as adjectives that express opinions (e.g., ""beautiful,"" ""terrible"") or words that convey facts (e.g., ""is,"" ""was,"" ""contains""), but also the overall tone and context of the sentence. Even if a sentence does not contain overtly evaluative language, the implied judgments or opinions about the characters' behaviors and situations can still indicate subjectivity. If a sentence contains both objective and subjective elements, classify it based on the predominant type of information presented. How would you classify the following sentence?
