Input: since bursting onto the music scene last year with her double platinum first album 'pie on my face ' , tildy st .
Output: user
It seems like the sentence you provided is incomplete and does not form a complete thought or statement. However, based on the part you've given, it appears to be describing an objective fact about an artist named Tildy St. and her success with her first album. If the sentence were to continue in this manner, describing factual information about her music career, it would be considered objective. If it were to include opinions or feelings about her music, it would be subjective.

Since the sentence is incomplete, I can't definitively categorize it, but based on the information provided, it leans towards being objective.

Input: based on a true story , the blue butterfly tells the story of a terminally ill 10-year-old boy whose dream is to catch the most beautiful butterfly on earth , the mythic and elusive blue morpho .
Output: user_guidelines

To determine if the sentence is objective or subjective, we need to examine whether it presents facts or opinions. 

1. **Identify the core content**: The sentence describes a narrative based on a true story about a terminally ill boy and his dream to catch a specific butterfly.
2. **Check for factual elements**: The sentence mentions a terminally ill 10-year-old boy and a specific butterfly (the blue morpho). These are factual elements.
3. **Check for subjective elements**: The sentence includes phrases like ""dream is to catch the most beautiful butterfly on earth"" and ""mythic and elusive blue morpho."" The term ""most beautiful"" is subjective, as beauty is a matter of personal opinion. However, the rest of the sentence is factual.

Given that the sentence primarily conveys factual information with a minor subjective element, it leans more towards being objective.

Input: the film 's apocalyptic urban setting and unrelentingly icy zeitgeist is message enough without a triumphant parting shot
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""the film's apocalyptic urban setting"" - This part describes the setting of the film, which is a factual description of the film's content.
2. ""unrelentingly icy zeitgeist"" - This phrase describes the overall mood or spirit of the film, which is more interpretive and can be seen as subjective.
3. ""is message enough without a triumphant parting shot"" - This part suggests that the film's message is clear and strong enough without needing a specific ending, which is an opinion about the effectiveness of the film's message and its ending.

The sentence includes both factual elements and interpretive elements. However, the overall tone leans more towards expressing an opinion about the film's message and its ending, rather than stating objective facts.

Therefore, the sentence is subjective.

Input: the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity : a movie without an apparent audience .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence to determine if it is subjective or objective.

1. ""the comedy death to smoochy is a rancorous curiosity"" - The use of the term ""rancorous curiosity"" is subjective. ""Rancorous"" implies bitterness or ill will, which is a subjective assessment of the film. ""Curiosity"" suggests something unusual or strange, which is also a subjective opinion.

2. ""a movie without an apparent audience"" - This part is somewhat objective in stating that the movie doesn't seem to have a clear audience. However, the phrase ""without an apparent audience"" still carries a subjective tone, as it implies a personal assessment of the film's reception.

Given these points, the sentence conveys personal feelings and opinions about the movie, making it subjective.

It seems like the sentence you provided is incomplete and does not form a complete thought or statement. However, based on the part you've given, it appears to be describing an objective fact about an artist named Tildy St. and her success with her first album.

If it were to include opinions or feelings about her music, it would be subjective.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""Nair doesn't treat the issues lightly. She allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly.""

This sentence involves an evaluation of how Nair (presumably a filmmaker or writer) handles the issues in her work. The phrases ""doesn't treat the issues lightly"" and ""allows each character to confront their problems openly and honestly"" are interpretative and based on the perspective of the observer. These phrases suggest a personal assessment of Nair's approach and the manner in which the characters are portrayed, rather than stating a verifiable fact.

Output: user
It seems like the sentence you provided is incomplete and does not form a complete thought or statement. However, based on the part you've given, it appears to be describing an objective fact about an artist named Tildy St. and her success with her first album. If the sentence were to continue in this manner, describing factual information about her music career, it would be considered objective. If it were to include opinions or feelings about her music, it would be subjective.

Since the sentence is incomplete, I can't definitively categorize it, but based on the information provided, it leans towards being objective.

Output: user
To determine whether the given sentence is objective or subjective, we need to analyze whether it presents a fact or expresses an opinion.

The sentence ""in visual fertility treasure planet rivals the top japanese animations of recent vintage"" contains the phrase ""rivals the top,"" which suggests a comparison and implies a judgment or opinion about the quality or status of ""Treasure Planet"" relative to other Japanese animations. The term ""visual fertility"" is also somewhat subjective, as it could be interpreted differently by various individuals.

Given these elements, the sentence is more about conveying a personal viewpoint or assessment rather than stating a verifiable fact.

Input: in the early years , mitra is repeatedly punished as the warden tries to break her .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""In the early years, Mitra is repeatedly punished as the warden tries to break her.""

This sentence describes a series of events and actions taken by characters, which could be based on factual occurrences within the context of a story or narrative. It does not express personal opinions, emotions, or assessments but rather states what happens to the character Mitra. Therefore, it can be considered an objective statement within its context.

Input: the characters seem one-dimensional , and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence provided:

""the characters seem one-dimensional, and the film is superficial and will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience.""

- ""the characters seem one-dimensional"" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it involves an assessment of the characters based on the viewer's perception. The use of ""seem"" indicates a personal judgment rather than a factual statement.
- ""the film is superficial"" - This is also subjective as it involves a personal judgment about the depth or quality of the film.
- ""will probably be of interest primarily to its target audience"" - This part is somewhat subjective because it involves a prediction about the film's appeal, which can vary based on personal opinions and the characteristics of the target audience.

Given these points, the sentence is primarily expressing personal opinions and judgments about the film and its characters.

It seems like the sentence you provided is incomplete and does not form a complete thought or statement. However, based on the part you've given, it appears to be describing an objective fact about an artist named Tildy St. and her success with her first album. If the sentence were to continue in this manner, describing factual information about her music career, it would be considered objective. If it were to include opinions or feelings about her music, it would be subjective.

Since the sentence is incomplete, I can't definitively categorize it, but based on the information provided, it leans towards being objective.
