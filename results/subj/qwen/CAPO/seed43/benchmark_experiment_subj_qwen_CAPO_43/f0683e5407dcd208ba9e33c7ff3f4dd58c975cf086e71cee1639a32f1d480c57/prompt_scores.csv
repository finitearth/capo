It seems like the sentence you provided is incomplete and does not form a complete thought or statement. However, based on the part you've given, it appears to be describing an objective fact about an artist named Tildy St. and her success with her first album. If the sentence were to continue in this manner, describing factual information about her music career, it would be considered objective. If it were to include opinions or feelings about her music, it would be subjective.

Since the sentence is incomplete, I can't definitively categorize it, but based on the information provided, it leans towards being objective.
