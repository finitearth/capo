However, it's important to note that while the sentence describes events and actions (Potter beginning his second year, being warned by a creature), which are factual in nature, the inclusion of elements like ""mysterious creature"" and ""danger awaits"" can introduce a subjective tone. Yet, based on the given sentence alone, it primarily states what is happening to the character, which leans more towards being objective.

Input: since bursting onto the music scene last year with her double platinum first album 'pie on my face ' , tildy st .
Output: user
It seems like the sentence you provided is incomplete and does not form a complete thought or statement. However, based on the part you've given, it appears to be describing an objective fact about an artist named Tildy St. and her success with her first album. If the sentence were to continue in this manner, describing factual information about her music career, it would be considered objective. If it were to include opinions or feelings about her music, it would be subjective.

Since the sentence is incomplete, I can't definitively categorize it, but based on the information provided, it leans towards being objective.
