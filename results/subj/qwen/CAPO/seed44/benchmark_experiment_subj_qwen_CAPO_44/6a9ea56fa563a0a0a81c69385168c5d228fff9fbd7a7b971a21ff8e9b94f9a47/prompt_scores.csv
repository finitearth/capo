Input: scherfig , who has had a successful career in tv , tackles more than she can handle .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""Scherfig, who has had a successful career in TV, tackles more than she can handle.""

1. The first part of the sentence, ""Scherfig, who has had a successful career in TV,"" is a statement that can be verified by checking Scherfig's career history. This part is objective.

2. However, the second part, ""tackles more than she can handle,"" is an opinion. The phrase ""more than she can handle"" is subjective because it involves an assessment of Scherfig's capabilities and the scope of her projects, which can vary from person to person.

Since the sentence includes a subjective opinion, the overall statement is subjective.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references"" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term ""undeniable enjoyment"" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. ""but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening"" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase ""the fun wears thin"" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""five screenwriters are credited with the cliché-laden screenplay"" - This part of the sentence is factual and can be verified by checking the credits of the screenplay. It is an objective statement.

2. ""it seems as if each watered down the version of the one before"" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it expresses a personal opinion or interpretation about the quality of the screenplay and the process of its creation. The use of ""seems as if"" and ""watered down"" indicates a personal judgment rather than a verifiable fact.

Given that the sentence contains both an objective and a subjective component, the overall sentiment leans towards being subjective due to the personal judgment expressed in the latter part of the sentence.

Output: user_guidance
Let's analyze the sentence step by step to determine if it is objective or subjective.

1. ""after one gets the feeling that the typical hollywood disregard for historical truth and realism is at work here"" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it involves a personal feeling and a judgment about Hollywood's approach to historical truth and realism. The phrase ""gets the feeling"" and ""typical hollywood disregard"" are based on personal perception and opinion.

2. ""it 's a matter of finding entertainment in the experiences of zishe and the fiery presence of hanussen"" - This part is also subjective. It suggests that the entertainment value is a matter of personal interpretation and enjoyment, which can vary from person to person. The term ""fiery presence"" is a subjective description of Hanussen.

Let's analyze the sentence ""a byzantine melodrama that stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido.""

- ""a byzantine melodrama"" - This part of the sentence describes the nature of the melodrama as complex or intricate, which could be seen as subjective since it's a matter of perception.
- ""stimulates the higher brain functions as well as the libido"" - This part of the sentence suggests effects on cognitive and sexual functions, which could be subjective as it involves personal experience and perception.

Given that the sentence includes terms and descriptions that are based on personal experience and perception, it is more subjective than objective.

The sentence describes a series of events and motivations of a character named Mike Sullivan.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot.""

1. The sentence includes evaluative language such as ""ludicrous and contrived,"" which are subjective terms expressing the author's opinion about the plot.
2. The phrase ""cultural moat"" is a metaphorical expression, suggesting a barrier that is hard to overcome, which also reflects a subjective viewpoint.
3. The sentence implies a judgment about the effectiveness of the chM-bteau in overcoming this barrier, which is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal assessment.

Based on these points, the sentence is subjective.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence provided:

1. ""on guard! won't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers"" - This is a subjective opinion as it involves a personal judgment about the quality of the film compared to others in the genre.

2. ""it is a whole lot of fun"" - This is also subjective as it expresses a personal enjoyment or opinion about the film.

3. ""you get to see one of the world's best actors, daniel auteuil"" - This part is more objective as it refers to Daniel Auteuil being considered one of the world's best actors, which is a fact based on critical acclaim and awards. However, the phrase ""one of the world's best actors"" can still be subjective as it is based on opinions.

4. ""have a whale of a good time"" - This is subjective as it expresses a personal sentiment about the actor's performance and enjoyment.

Given the overall content of the sentence, it is predominantly subjective due to the personal opinions and feelings expressed about the film and the enjoyment derived from it.

Input: minority report is exactly what the title indicates , a report .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence ""minority report is exactly what the title indicates, a report.""

The sentence suggests that the term ""minority report"" refers to a report, which is a factual description of what a minority report is. However, the use of ""exactly what the title indicates"" introduces a subjective element, as it implies a personal interpretation or emphasis on the definition. While the core statement about the nature of a minority report being a report is factual, the phrasing suggests a personal view on the accuracy of the title.

Given this analysis, the sentence leans more towards being subjective due to the personal emphasis and interpretation.

""An old-fashioned screenwriting term is used here, suggesting that Ms. Shreve's novel was too complex to adapt into a screenplay, even with a high-quality cast.""

- The sentence includes a subjective judgment about the complexity of the novel and the difficulty of adapting it, which are opinions that can vary from person to person.
- The phrase ""too difficult a text to 'lick'"" is a subjective assessment, as it implies a personal or collective opinion on the adaptability of the novel.

Input: these blow up another ship with jews , deports and jails the atlantic 's refugees in palestine , and then deports them to far-off mauritius islands for 5 years in jail : until the end of the war .
Output: user_assistant

This sentence contains a mix of factual information and potentially subjective elements. The factual part is about actions taken against a group of people, including the deportation and jailing of refugees. However, the inclusion of specific groups (Jews, refugees) and the description of actions taken against them could be seen as carrying a subjective tone, especially if the context implies a negative judgment or sentiment towards the actions described.

Given the detailed and specific nature of the events described, and the lack of clear emotional language, the sentence leans more towards being objective. However, the inclusion of specific groups and the description of their treatment could be seen as potentially biased or subjective depending on the broader context.

Input: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step to determine if it is presenting objective facts or subjective opinions, emotions, or evaluations.

1. **""the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot.""**
   - **""chM-bteau""**: This seems to be a typo or a misspelling, possibly intended to be ""chateau."" However, this doesn't affect the analysis of the sentence's content.
   - **""never quite able to overcome""**: This phrase suggests a subjective evaluation of the chateau's ability to overcome something, indicating a personal perspective.
   - **""cultural moat""**: This is a metaphorical expression, suggesting a barrier or divide, which is more interpretive and subjective.
   - **""ludicrous and contrived plot""**: The use of the words ""ludicrous"" and ""contrived"" are clearly evaluative and subjective, expressing a personal opinion about the plot.

Given the evaluative language and the use of subjective terms, the sentence is conveying personal perspectives and opinions rather than objective facts.

Output: user
To determine if the given sentence is objective or subjective, we need to analyze whether it conveys factual information or personal opinions, feelings, or judgments.

The sentence describes a series of events and situations:
1. A man discovers his daughter's life is in danger.
2. The daughter's existence was unknown to him due to an affair with a Brazilian woman 15 years earlier.
3. He must return to Rio.
4. He has only five days to finish a deal and find his daughter.

These statements describe specific events and situations without expressing personal opinions, feelings, or judgments. They provide neutral, factual information about the circumstances and actions of the characters involved.

Input: there 's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references , but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there 's nothing else happening .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references"" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term ""undeniable enjoyment"" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. ""but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening"" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase ""the fun wears thin"" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Input: the transfer to the imax screen diminishes none of the film 's drama , which was always much more about human emotions than technology .
Output: user
Let's break down the sentence to determine if it is objective or subjective.

1. ""The transfer to the IMAX screen diminishes none of the film's drama"" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it involves a personal judgment about the quality of the film's drama after the transfer to IMAX. The term ""diminishes none"" is a subjective assessment of the film's drama.

2. ""which was always much more about human emotions than technology"" - This part is also subjective because it involves a personal interpretation of the film's focus. The use of ""always"" and ""much more"" indicates a personal viewpoint on the film's emphasis.

Given that both parts of the sentence involve personal judgments and interpretations, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Input: this film puts wang at the forefront of china 's sixth generation of film makers .
Output: user_rewrite
Evaluate whether the sentence ""This film puts Wang at the forefront of China's sixth generation of filmmakers."" is expressing an objective fact or a subjective opinion.

To determine if the sentence is objective or subjective, we need to consider whether the statement can be proven true or false based on factual evidence or if it reflects a personal viewpoint or sentiment.

The sentence suggests that Wang is considered a leading figure among a specific group of filmmakers. This could be seen as a subjective opinion because it involves a judgment about Wang's status and influence within the film industry. The term ""forefront"" implies a ranking or evaluation that can vary based on different perspectives and criteria.

Therefore, the sentence is conveying a subjective view rather than an objective fact.

Let's analyze the sentence provided:

""though howard demonstrates a great eye as a director, this southern gothic drama is sadly a tough sit, with an undeveloped narrative and enough flashbacks and heavy-handed metaphors to choke a horse -- or at least slow him down to a canter.""

This sentence contains both subjective and objective elements. The part ""howard demonstrates a great eye as a director"" is subjective because it's an opinion about Howard's directing skills. The rest of the sentence is also subjective, as it expresses the writer's personal feelings about the film's narrative and style, using phrases like ""tough sit,"" ""undeveloped narrative,"" and ""heavy-handed metaphors."" The metaphor ""to choke a horse"" is also a subjective expression of the writer's opinion.

Input: gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""gangs, despite the gravity of its subject matter, is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western.""

1. The sentence is making a comparison between the enjoyment derived from watching a film about gangs and watching a spaghetti western.
2. The term ""fun to watch"" is subjective, as it reflects a personal judgment about the entertainment value of the film.
3. The comparison to a ""good spaghetti western"" also involves a subjective evaluation, as what constitutes a ""good"" western can vary from person to person.

Given these points, the sentence conveys a personal viewpoint and cannot be considered an objective fact.

Let's break down the sentence to determine if it is objective or subjective.

1. ""impossible as it may sound, this film's heart is even more embracing than monty"" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it expresses a personal opinion about the film's emotional impact and compares it to another film (presumably ""Monty Python"" or a film directed by Monty Python).

2. ""if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition"" - This part is also subjective as it interprets the film's portrayal of human behavior and flaws, which is a matter of personal interpretation.

The sentence as a whole expresses personal feelings and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick"" - This part of the sentence is stating a fact about the movie Kung Pow and its creator's intentions, which can be verified.

2. ""and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that"" - This part is subjective because it expresses a personal opinion or judgment about the realization of childhood dreams.

Since the sentence contains both a factual statement and a subjective opinion, the overall classification of the sentence is subjective due to the presence of the opinionated part.

<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>

Input: this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang 's forte and it shows .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence:

""this sort of cute and cloying material is far from zhang 's forte and it shows.""

- ""cute and cloying"" are subjective descriptors, as they are based on personal feelings and tastes.
- ""far from zhang's forte"" suggests that the material is not something Zhang is good at, which is a subjective judgment about Zhang's abilities.
- ""it shows"" implies that the lack of skill is evident, which can be subjective as different people might perceive it differently.

Given these elements, the sentence is expressing a personal opinion and judgment about the material and Zhang's abilities, rather than stating an objective fact.

Let's analyze the sentences provided:

1. ""Imamura has said that warm water under a red bridge is a poem to the enduring strengths of women.""
   - This sentence attributes a statement to Imamura, suggesting that a particular work (presumably a film or piece of writing) is a tribute to the enduring strengths of women. This is a subjective interpretation of the work's meaning and reflects Imamura's personal view or opinion about the work.

2. ""It may also be the best sex comedy about environmental pollution ever made.""
   - This sentence is subjective because it includes a superlative (""the best"") and a personal judgment about the quality and genre classification of the work.

Based on the analysis, both sentences contain subjective opinions rather than objective facts.

Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""cold and scattered, minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals.""
   - ""cold and scattered"" are subjective descriptors, indicating personal feelings or opinions.
   - ""commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals"" is a subjective statement, as it reflects the author's personal view on what the movie is about and how it captures interest.

2. ""that's not vintage spielberg""
   - This is a subjective statement, as it compares the movie to the director's typical style, which is a matter of opinion.

3. ""that, finally, is minimally satisfying.""
   - This is a subjective statement, as it expresses the author's personal level of satisfaction with the movie.

Given the analysis, the sentence contains subjective opinions and personal judgments about the movie ""Minority Report.""

The sentence ""Anna is followed everywhere she goes by a creepy pale assailant with a knife."" contains descriptive words like ""creepy"" and ""pale,"" which are subjective terms that can vary based on personal feelings or opinions. However, the core of the sentence describes a scenario that could be factually verified if it were to occur. Despite the subjective descriptors, the sentence is fundamentally describing a situation that could be objectively confirmed. Therefore, the primary classification should be based on the verifiable action (being followed by an assailant with a knife), which is an objective fact.

Input: it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence:

""it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects, and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes.""

- ""it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects"" - This part is subjective because it expresses a personal feeling and judgment about the quality and style of the special effects and the plot.
- ""watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes"" - This is also subjective as it compares the excitement level of watching the plot to a mundane activity, which is a personal opinion.

Since both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and judgments, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Input: the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence provided:

""the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure.""

This sentence is making a statement about the values that have kept the Enterprise crew together. It mentions specific values such as courage, self-sacrifice, and patience under pressure. However, the statement is not presenting a verifiable fact but rather an interpretation or assessment of the crew's behavior and the qualities that have sustained them. The use of terms like ""values,"" ""held together,"" and ""adventures and perils"" suggests a subjective evaluation of the crew's experiences and attributes.

Input: while dutifully pulling on heartstrings , directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""while dutifully pulling on heartstrings, directors dean deblois and chris sanders valiantly keep punching up the mix.""

This sentence contains an opinion about the actions of the directors, using words like ""dutifully,"" ""valiantly,"" and ""punching up the mix,"" which suggest a subjective view on their efforts and the emotional impact of their work. Therefore, this sentence is subjective.

Input: it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects , and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes .
Output: userHeaderCodeassistantHeaderCode
To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. ""it feels like an after-school special gussied up with some fancy special effects"" - This part of the sentence expresses a personal opinion about the quality and style of something, likely a movie or TV show. The use of ""feels like"" and ""gussied up"" indicates a subjective viewpoint.

2. ""and watching its rote plot points connect is about as exciting as gazing at an egg timer for 93 minutes"" - This is a subjective comparison that conveys the speaker's personal experience and opinion about the excitement level of watching the plot unfold. The comparison to watching an egg timer for 93 minutes is a clear expression of boredom and disinterest, which is a subjective feeling.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal opinions and feelings, the sentence is subjective.

Let's analyze the sentence to determine if it is subjective or objective.

The sentence is: ""the merchant-ivory team continues to systematically destroy everything we hold dear about cinema, only now it's begun to split up so that it can do even more damage.""

1. The sentence expresses a strong opinion about the actions of the Merchant-Ivory team, using words like ""destroy"" and ""damage,"" which are emotionally charged and indicate a personal viewpoint.
2. The phrase ""everything we hold dear about cinema"" is subjective, as it refers to personal or collective feelings and values.
3. The sentence also suggests a negative impact (""do even more damage""), which is a subjective evaluation.

Given these points, the sentence is clearly expressing personal opinions and feelings, making it subjective.

Input: a supernatural mystery that does n't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama . it ends up being neither , and fails at both endeavors .
Output: user_guidance
Let's analyze the sentence step by step to determine if it is objective or subjective.

1. ""a supernatural mystery that doesn't know whether it wants to be a suspenseful horror movie or a weepy melodrama.""
   - This part of the sentence describes the movie's genre and its perceived indecision about its genre. The use of ""doesn't know whether it wants to be"" is a subjective assessment, as it attributes intent and indecision to the movie, which are not factual but rather interpretative.

2. ""it ends up being neither, and fails at both endeavors.""
   - This part of the sentence makes a judgment about the movie's success or failure in its genre attempts. The terms ""fails"" and ""ends up being neither"" are subjective, as they are based on personal opinion and not on verifiable facts.

Given that the sentence contains phrases that express personal opinions and judgments, it is categorized as subjective.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step to determine if it is objective or subjective.

1. ""originality ai n't on the menu"" - This part of the sentence suggests a lack of originality, which is a subjective assessment. It implies that the content is not original, but this is a matter of opinion and not a fact that can be objectively confirmed.

2. ""but there 's never a dull moment in the giant spider invasion comic chiller"" - This part of the sentence is also subjective. It expresses the opinion that the comic is exciting and never boring, which is a personal sentiment and not a fact that can be objectively verified.

Given that both parts of the sentence contain subjective assessments and personal opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step to determine if it's objective or subjective.

1. ""the characters are so generic and the plot so bland"" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it expresses an opinion about the characters and plot. The terms ""generic"" and ""bland"" are subjective and based on personal views.

2. ""even as rogue cia assassins working for chris cooper 's agency boss close in on the resourceful amnesiac"" - This part of the sentence describes a plot element and is more objective. However, the use of ""resourceful"" is slightly subjective as it involves an assessment of the character's traits.

3. ""we do n't feel much for damon/bourne or his predicament"" - This part is subjective because it expresses a personal sentiment about the audience's emotional response to the character and the plot.

Given that the sentence contains subjective opinions and personal sentiments, it cannot be categorized as objective.

Input: the internment of 120 , 000 innocent people was a dark moment in the history of this country .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. **""The internment of 120,000 innocent people""**:
   - The term ""internment"" refers to the confinement of a group of people, often during wartime, which is a factual statement.
   - The number ""120,000"" is a specific figure that can be verified through historical records.
   - The term ""innocent people"" is subjective, as it implies a moral judgment about the individuals who were interned.

2. **""was a dark moment in the history of this country""**:
   - ""Dark moment"" is a subjective term that conveys a negative emotional or moral judgment about the event.
   - ""History of this country"" is a factual reference to the historical context.

The sentence combines factual elements (the number of people interned) with subjective elements (the characterization of the people as ""innocent"" and the event as a ""dark moment"").

Input: a murder in the camp gives him the chance to set a risky plan in motion .

The given sentence describes a scenario where a murder provides an opportunity for someone to initiate a risky plan. This statement is not presenting a verifiable fact or unbiased information. Instead, it conveys a narrative or a plot point that involves subjective elements such as the interpretation of the situation and the emotional or strategic implications of the murder for the individual's plan. Therefore, this sentence is a subjective claim.

Input: he has just graduated college , he has a beautiful girlfriend , jane , and a publisher has picked up his first novel .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence provided:

1. ""He has just graduated college"" - This is an objective claim as it can be verified through official records or documentation.
2. ""He has a beautiful girlfriend, Jane"" - The term ""beautiful"" is subjective as it is based on personal opinions and can vary from person to person. The existence of the girlfriend, Jane, could be an objective fact, but the description of her as ""beautiful"" is subjective.
3. ""A publisher has picked up his first novel"" - This is an objective claim as it can be verified through records or statements from the publisher.

Given the presence of the subjective term ""beautiful,"" the sentence as a whole contains a subjective claim.

Let's analyze the sentence step by step:

1. ""there's undeniable enjoyment to be had from films crammed with movie references"" - This part of the sentence expresses a subjective opinion. The term ""undeniable enjoyment"" is a personal feeling and can vary from person to person. It is not a verifiable fact.

2. ""but the fun wears thin -- then out -- when there's nothing else happening"" - This part also conveys a subjective opinion. The phrase ""the fun wears thin"" is a subjective assessment of the entertainment value of the films, which can differ among individuals.

Given that both parts of the sentence express personal feelings and opinions, the sentence as a whole is subjective.

Let's analyze the sentence ""it 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby.""

1. The sentence begins with ""it's hard to believe,"" which is a phrase often used to express disbelief or surprise. This suggests a personal reaction or opinion rather than a verifiable fact.
2. The terms ""short"" and ""flabby"" are subjective descriptors. ""Short"" can mean different things depending on the context and the speaker's perspective. Similarly, ""flabby"" is a subjective term often used to describe a lack of firmness or quality, which can vary based on individual standards or opinions.
3. The sentence does not present any factual information that can be independently verified. Instead, it conveys a personal judgment or feeling about something.

Given these points, the sentence is expressing a personal opinion or feeling rather than a verifiable fact.

This sentence includes several evaluative terms (""clinical,"" ""detached,"" ""uninvolving"") that express the author's personal assessment of the project. These terms are subjective because they reflect the author's feelings and opinions rather than presenting verifiable facts. Additionally, the phrase ""possibly prompting audience members to wonder, 'what's the point?'"" suggests a subjective interpretation of how the audience might react, which is not a quantifiable or verifiable fact but rather a personal assessment.
