"Analyze each sentence to decide if it conveys an objective fact, which is a statement that can be verified as true or false without any personal bias, or a subjective opinion, which involves personal feelings, judgments, or assessments that may vary among individuals. Your task is to categorize each sentence as either 'subjective', indicating it includes opinions, emotions, or judgments, or 'objective', meaning it is based on verifiable facts and is free from personal bias.

Input: he falls for hunky diner owner matt , who falls just as hard back .

Input: day in , day out , the same routine is repeated .
Output: user
To determine whether the sentence ""day in, day out, the same routine is repeated"" is objective or subjective, we need to consider if it can be verified as true or false without personal bias.

The sentence describes a repetitive action (""the same routine is repeated"") that occurs consistently (""day in, day out""). This statement can be observed and verified by someone who is aware of the routine and can confirm its repetition over time. It does not include personal feelings, judgments, or assessments that may vary among individuals.

Therefore, the sentence is an objective fact.

<final_answer>objective</final_answer>

Input: welles groupie/scholar peter bogdanovich took a long time to do it , but he 's finally provided his own broadside at publishing giant william randolph hearst .
Output: user
This sentence contains a mix of objective and subjective elements. The part about Peter Bogdanovich taking a long time to provide his own ""broadside"" at William Randolph Hearst can be verified as an objective fact. However, the use of the term ""broadside"" implies a subjective judgment about the nature of Bogdanovich's work. Since the sentence cannot be entirely categorized as objective due to the inclusion of this subjective term, it should be classified as subjective.

<final_answer>subjective</final_answer>

Input: a movie that will surely be profane , politically charged music to the ears of cho 's fans .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""a movie that will surely be profane, politically charged music to the ears of cho's fans.""

1. ""a movie that will surely be profane"" - This part of the sentence suggests a prediction about the content of the movie, which could be verified as true or false. However, the use of ""surely"" introduces a level of certainty that might not be based on factual evidence but rather on the speaker's belief or expectation.

2. ""politically charged"" - This phrase describes the movie's content as having political themes or implications, which can be a factual description if the movie indeed contains such elements.

3. ""music to the ears of cho's fans"" - This is a metaphorical expression indicating that the movie will be enjoyable or pleasing to the fans of someone named Cho. This part is subjective because it involves a judgment about how the fans will feel about the movie, which can vary from person to person.

Given the presence of subjective language and the prediction without factual evidence, the overall sentence leans more towards being subjective.

Input: after chance brings them together they create , 'searching for mr right . com , `` a web site to locate husbands for marie and liz .
Output: user
This sentence describes a scenario where two individuals create a website to find husbands, which is a factual statement about an action taken by the subjects. However, the context and the purpose of the action (""to locate husbands for Marie and Liz"") might be seen as subjective because it involves personal desires and intentions. Yet, the core of the sentence is describing an action that can be verified, making it more aligned with an objective statement.

Let's analyze the sentence: ""the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth that it brings tears to your eyes.""

- ""the drama is played out with such aching beauty and truth"" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it involves personal feelings and perceptions about the drama's beauty and truth.
- ""that it brings tears to your eyes"" - This part is also subjective as it describes an emotional reaction, which can vary from person to person.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""Peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed, adult hindsight.""

- The sentence includes the phrase ""could have used,"" which implies a judgment or opinion about what might have improved the subject's work.
- ""Mythmaking"" is a term that can be subjective, as it suggests the creation of stories or narratives that may not be entirely factual.
- ""Informed, adult hindsight"" is a subjective phrase, as it implies a personal view on what constitutes ""informed"" and ""adult"" perspectives.

Given these elements, the sentence expresses opinions and judgments rather than stating verifiable facts.

The first part, ""life on the rez is no picnic,"" is a subjective statement. It expresses a personal perspective or feeling about life on a reservation, which can vary from person to person.

Input: blueberry is stationed in the little town of palomito as sheriff .
Output: user
To determine whether the sentence is objective or subjective, let's break it down:

""blueberry is stationed in the little town of palomito as sheriff.""

- The sentence states that ""blueberry"" (presumably a person's name) is in a specific role (sheriff) in a specific location (the town of Palomito).
- The statement does not include any personal opinions, emotions, or evaluations. It is a straightforward assertion about a person's position and location.

Based on this analysis, the sentence is presenting an objective fact.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence provided:

""this re-do is so dumb and so exploitative in its violence that, ironically, it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against.""

1. ""this re-do is so dumb"" - This part of the sentence expresses a personal opinion about the quality of the re-do, which is subjective.
2. ""so exploitative in its violence"" - This part also conveys a subjective judgment about the nature of the violence in the re-do.
3. ""ironically, it becomes everything that the rather clumsy original was railing against"" - This part includes a subjective assessment of the original work as ""clumsy"" and a subjective interpretation of what the original was ""railing against.""

Given that the sentence contains multiple subjective judgments and personal opinions, it cannot be classified as an objective fact.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""Barney has created a tour de force that is weird, wacky and wonderful.""

- ""Barney has created a tour de force"" - This part of the sentence could be considered objective if it can be verified that Barney indeed created something that qualifies as a tour de force (a work that shows off a creator's greatest abilities). However, the term ""tour de force"" itself can be subjective as it depends on the perception of the audience or critics.

- ""weird, wacky and wonderful"" - These are subjective descriptors. The terms ""weird,"" ""wacky,"" and ""wonderful"" are based on personal feelings and opinions. What one person finds weird or wonderful, another might not.

Given that the sentence includes subjective descriptors and the term ""tour de force"" can also be subjective, the overall classification of the sentence is subjective.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence provided:

""Ranging from funny to shattering and featuring some of the year's best acting, Personal Velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum.""

1. ""Ranging from funny to shattering"" - This part of the sentence is subjective because it describes the emotional impact of the film, which can vary from person to person.
2. ""featuring some of the year's best acting"" - This is subjective as it involves a personal judgment about the quality of the acting.
3. ""Personal Velocity gathers plenty of dramatic momentum"" - This is also subjective as it involves a personal assessment of the film's ability to build tension or interest.

Since the sentence contains subjective language throughout, it cannot be classified as an objective statement.

Let's analyze each sentence:

1. ""You have to pay attention to follow all the stories, but they're each interesting.""
   - This sentence contains both objective and subjective elements. The part ""You have to pay attention to follow all the stories"" is objective as it describes a requirement for understanding the plot. However, ""they're each interesting"" is subjective because the perception of interest can vary from person to person.
   - Classification: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>

2. ""The movie is well shot and very tragic, and one to ponder after the credits roll.""
   - ""The movie is well shot"" can be considered objective as it refers to the technical quality of the film, which can be evaluated based on cinematography standards. However, ""very tragic"" and ""one to ponder after the credits roll"" are subjective as they express personal feelings and judgments about the emotional impact and the depth of the movie's themes.
   - Classification: <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>

In summary, both sentences contain subjective elements and are therefore classified as subjective.

Input: dennis clegg is in his thirties and lives in a halfway house for the mentally ill in london .
Output: user
To determine if the given sentence is objective or subjective, let's break it down:

1. ""Dennis Clegg is in his thirties"" - This is a factual statement that can be verified by checking Dennis Clegg's age. It is objective.
2. ""lives in a halfway house for the mentally ill in London"" - This is also a factual statement that can be verified by checking Dennis Clegg's residence and the nature of the facility. It is objective.

Since both parts of the sentence are factual and can be verified, the entire sentence is an objective statement.

1. ""Despite the 2-d animation"" - This part of the sentence is objective as it describes a factual aspect of the movie, specifically that it uses 2-dimensional animation.

2. ""the Wild Thornberrys movie makes for a surprisingly cinematic experience"" - This part is subjective. The term ""cinematic experience"" is a personal evaluation and the use of ""surprisingly"" indicates a personal reaction or judgment.

Input: hardly a masterpiece , but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence provided:

""hardly a masterpiece, but it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise and some interesting real people.""

1. ""hardly a masterpiece"" - This part of the sentence is subjective. It expresses a personal opinion about the quality of something, likely a film or a piece of art, and the term ""masterpiece"" is subjective as it can vary from person to person.

2. ""it introduces viewers to a good charitable enterprise"" - The phrase ""good charitable enterprise"" is subjective. The term ""good"" is a value judgment and can vary based on personal opinions and beliefs.

3. ""and some interesting real people"" - The term ""interesting"" is subjective, as what is considered interesting can vary from person to person.

Given that the sentence contains subjective terms and personal opinions, it cannot be classified as an objective fact.

Input: the dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""The dialogue is very choppy and monosyllabic despite the fact that it is being dubbed.""

The sentence contains an evaluation of the quality and style of the dialogue, specifically describing it as ""choppy"" and ""monosyllabic."" These descriptors are subjective because they are based on personal perception and can vary from one person to another. The term ""very"" also intensifies the subjective nature of the statement, as it reflects a personal judgment about the degree to which the dialogue is choppy and monosyllabic.

Therefore, the sentence is expressing a subjective perspective.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence to determine if it is subjective or objective.

1. The sentence discusses a ""romance"" and a ""world"" described as ""impossible."" This is a description of a narrative or a story, which is inherently subjective as it involves interpretation and personal perspective.

2. The phrase ""dare us to say why either is impossible"" suggests a challenge to the reader's beliefs or perceptions, which is a subjective statement as it involves personal opinions and feelings.

3. The sentence concludes with ""forces us to confront what's possible and what we might do to make it so,"" which is a subjective statement as it involves personal beliefs about what is possible and what actions might be taken.

Given these points, the sentence is clearly expressing opinions and interpretations rather than presenting factual information without personal bias. Therefore, the sentence is subjective.

Output: user_guidance
Let's analyze the sentence step by step to determine if it is subjective or objective.

1. **Identify the core statement**: The sentence describes how a drama is played out with ""aching beauty and truth"" and how it brings tears to one's eyes.

2. **Evaluate the components**:
   - ""aching beauty and truth"": This phrase is highly subjective. ""Aching beauty"" is an emotional and personal description, and ""truth"" in this context is a subjective interpretation of the drama's portrayal.
   - ""brings tears to your eyes"": This part is also subjective, as it describes an emotional reaction that can vary from person to person.

3. **Determine if the statement can be verified**:
   - The description of the drama's portrayal and the emotional reaction it evokes are based on personal feelings and cannot be universally verified as true or false.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The sentence conveys personal feelings and judgments about the drama, making it subjective.

Based on this analysis, the sentence is subjective.

- However, the belief itself is presented as a fact about what the police and investigators thought, not as the speaker's personal opinion.

Since the sentence is reporting what the police and investigators believed, it is conveying information that can be verified (i.e., whether the police and investigators indeed held this belief), making it an objective statement.

Let's analyze the sentence ""offers 102 minutes of breezy, occasionally very funny entertainment.""

1. The sentence includes a specific fact: ""102 minutes,"" which is an objective measurement of time.
2. However, the descriptors ""breezy"" and ""very funny"" are subjective. These terms are based on personal feelings and opinions about the entertainment.
3. The term ""entertainment"" itself can be subjective, as what one person finds entertaining, another might not.

Given that the sentence includes subjective descriptors and opinions, it cannot be classified as purely objective.
