Input: peralta 's mythmaking could have used some informed , adult hindsight .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""Peralta's mythmaking could have used some informed, adult hindsight.""

- The sentence includes the phrase ""could have used,"" which implies a judgment or opinion about what might have improved the subject's work.
- ""Mythmaking"" is a term that can be subjective, as it suggests the creation of stories or narratives that may not be entirely factual.
- ""Informed, adult hindsight"" is a subjective phrase, as it implies a personal view on what constitutes ""informed"" and ""adult"" perspectives.

Given these elements, the sentence expresses opinions and judgments rather than stating verifiable facts.

Input: land , people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence provided:

""land, people and narrative flow together in a stark portrait of motherhood deferred and desire explored.""

This sentence contains terms and phrases that express feelings, judgments, or opinions rather than stating verifiable facts. For example, ""stark portrait,"" ""motherhood deferred,"" and ""desire explored"" are subjective expressions that convey the author's interpretation or feelings about the subject matter. These phrases are not verifiable facts but rather subjective descriptions of the narrative's themes and atmosphere.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull.""

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement (""it isn't a bad film""), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as ""incredibly dull,"" which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Let's analyze the sentence: ""it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull.""

- It then proceeds to describe the film as ""incredibly dull,"" which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull.""

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement (""it isn't a bad film""), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as ""incredibly dull,"" which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Let's analyze the sentence: ""it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull.""

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement (""it isn't a bad film""), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as ""incredibly dull,"" which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull.""

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement (""it isn't a bad film""), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as ""incredibly dull,"" which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Let's analyze the sentence: ""it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull.""

Let's analyze the sentence: ""it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull.""

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement (""it isn't a bad film""), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as ""incredibly dull,"" which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull.""

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement (""it isn't a bad film""), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as ""incredibly dull,"" which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Input: it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film , because it is n't . it 's just incredibly dull .
Output: user
Let's analyze the sentence: ""it 's not that waiting for happiness is a bad film, because it isn't. it 's just incredibly dull.""

- The sentence starts with a negation of a negative statement (""it isn't a bad film""), which is an opinion.
- It then proceeds to describe the film as ""incredibly dull,"" which is a subjective judgment.

Given these points, the sentence contains personal opinions and judgments about the film, making it subjective.

Use your understanding of subjective and objective language to label each sentence as 'objective' for statements that are neutral and unbiased, or 'subjective' for those that express personal sentiments or evaluations. Your classification should reveal whether the sentence is 'subjective', indicating it expresses personal views or emotions, or 'objective', indicating it is based on facts and free from bias.
