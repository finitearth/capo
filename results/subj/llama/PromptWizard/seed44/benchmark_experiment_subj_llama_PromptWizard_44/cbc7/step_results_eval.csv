1," To classify sentences as objective or subjective, consider the following criteria: (1) presence of emotional language or personal opinions, (2) attribution of opinions to specific groups or individuals, and (3) neutral versus biased presentation of facts. A sentence is objective if it reports facts, attributes opinions to others without taking a stance, and uses neutral language. Use these criteria to evaluate each sentence and provide your answer between the markers <final_answer>your_answer</final_answer>, then assess the progress made so far. </START> 


[Question] The new policy has been met with widespread criticism from the public, with many expressing concerns about its potential impact on the environment.
[Answer] To classify the given sentence as subjective or objective, we will follow a step-by-step logical pathway based on the provided criteria: (1) presence of emotional language or personal opinions, (2) attribution of opinions to specific groups or individuals, and (3) neutral versus biased presentation of facts.

1. **Identify Emotional Language or Personal Opinions**: The first step is to examine the sentence for any emotional language or personal opinions. Emotional language often includes words or phrases that evoke emotions or express a personal viewpoint. In the sentence, ""The new policy has been met with widespread criticism from the public, with many expressing concerns about its potential impact on the environment,"" the words ""criticism"" and ""concerns"" could potentially be seen as indicators of negative sentiment. However, in this context, they are used to report on the reactions of others rather than to express the opinion of the speaker or writer.

2. **Analyze Attribution of Opinions**: Next, we determine if the sentence attributes opinions to specific groups or individuals. The sentence clearly attributes the criticism and concerns to ""the public"" and ""many,"" which are specific groups. This attribution is a key factor in maintaining objectivity, as it reports on what others think without endorsing or rejecting those opinions.

3 <ANS_START>To determine the subjectivity or objectivity of this sentence, let's break it down. The sentence reports on a factual event (the policy and public criticism) and attributes opinions to a group (the public), but does so in a neutral manner without expressing a personal opinion. The language used is informative and does not contain emotional appeals. Therefore, the sentence can be classified as objective because it sticks to reporting facts and attributed opinions without taking a stance. <ANS_START>objective<ANS_END><ANS_END>
