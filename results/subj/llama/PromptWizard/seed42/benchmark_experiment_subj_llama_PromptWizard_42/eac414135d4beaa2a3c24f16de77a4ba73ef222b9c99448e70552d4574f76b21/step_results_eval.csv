1,"The dataset contains sentences labeled as either subjective or objective. The task is to classify each sentence as either subjective or objective. The class will be extracted between the markers <final_answer>answer</final_answer>.

To accurately classify sentences as subjective or objective, consider the context, tone, and language used. A sentence is objective if it states facts, provides information, or quotes someone without expressing a personal opinion or bias. It's subjective if it expresses emotions, personal judgments, or opinions. When evaluating a sentence, pay attention to quoted statements, as they can be objective even if the quoted person expresses an opinion. Classify the given sentence as objective (states facts, provides information without personal bias) or subjective (expresses opinions, emotions, or personal judgments), and place your classification between the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.



[Question] The latest scientific study on climate change reveals a significant increase in global temperatures over the past decade, citing data from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
[Answer] To classify the given sentence as either subjective or objective, we will follow a step-by-step logical pathway that considers the context, tone, and language used in the sentence.

1. **Identify the Main Components of the Sentence**: The sentence mentions a ""scientific study on climate change,"" which indicates it is discussing a specific topic based on research. It also cites ""data from NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,"" which are reputable sources of scientific information.

2. **Analyze the Tone and Language**: The tone of the sentence is informative, aiming to convey information about the findings of a scientific study. The language used is formal and objective, focusing on presenting data and research findings without emotional appeals or personal opinions.

3. **Determine the Presence of Objective Indicators**: The sentence includes specific indicators of objectivity, such as the mention of a scientific study and the citation of data from well-respected scientific organizations. This suggests that the sentence is intended to inform or report on factual information rather than to persuade or express an opinion.

4. **Evaluate for Subjective Indicators**: We examine the sentence for words or phrases that might indicate subjectivity, such as emotional language, personal judgments, or opinions. The sentence lacks these indicators, as it does not express a <ANS_START>To classify this sentence, we need to examine its content and tone. The sentence discusses a scientific study and cites specific data from reputable sources like NASA and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. It presents information in a neutral manner without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. The focus is on reporting facts and data, which is characteristic of objective sentences. Therefore, the sentence is classified as objective because it provides factual information without bias or personal judgment. <ANS_START>objective<ANS_END><ANS_END>
