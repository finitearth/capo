1," To classify a sentence as subjective or objective, consider the language, tone, and context in which it is used. A subjective sentence typically expresses a personal opinion, emotion, or perspective, while an objective sentence provides factual information. When analyzing the tone, look for words or phrases that convey a positive, negative, or neutral sentiment, and consider how they contribute to the overall tone of the sentence. Be aware that sentences can contain both subjective and objective elements, and that subtle expressions of opinion or emotion can be implicit rather than explicit. Consider the context in which the sentence is used, including the author's purpose, audience, and potential biases. With this understanding, analyze the given sentence and classify it as either subjective or objective, placing your answer between <final_answer> tags. Be sure to consider the nuances of language and tone, and avoid relying solely on explicit expressions of opinion or emotion. Instead, take a holistic approach that accounts for the complexities of human language and the various ways in which subjectivity can be conveyed. 


[Question] marly has given her career as an aquatic weeki wachee mermaid up and her marriage to steve is over .
[Answer] To classify the given sentence as subjective or objective, we will follow a step-by-step logical pathway that considers the language, tone, and context in which the sentence is used.

1. **Initial Assessment**: The sentence provided is ""marly has given her career as an aquatic weeki wachee mermaid up and her marriage to steve is over."" The first step is to identify any explicit expressions of opinion, emotion, or factual information within the sentence.

2. **Language Analysis**: The sentence reports on two events: Marly ending her career as a Weeki Wachee mermaid and the end of her marriage to Steve. The language used (""given her career... up"" and ""her marriage... is over"") is straightforward and factual, without overt emotional or opinionated language.

3. **Tone Analysis**: The tone of the sentence appears neutral, as it simply states two facts without any words or phrases that convey a positive, negative, or emotional sentiment. There are no adjectives or adverbs that suggest a subjective evaluation of these events.

4. **Contextual Consideration**: Without additional context about the author's purpose, audience, or potential biases, we must rely on the sentence's content. The information provided is about specific life events (career <ANS_START>objective<ANS_END>

[Question] obviously a socialist commentary , poets is in turn informative , witty and thought-provoking .
[Answer] To classify the given sentence as subjective or objective, we will follow a step-by-step logical pathway that considers the language, tone, and context in which the sentence is used.

1. **Initial Assessment**: The sentence provided is ""obviously a socialist commentary, poets is in turn informative, witty and thought-provoking."" The first step is to recognize that the sentence contains an evaluation of something (poets or a commentary) based on certain qualities (informative, witty, thought-provoking).

2. **Tone Analysis**: The tone of the sentence seems positive due to the use of words like ""informative,"" ""witty,"" and ""thought-provoking,"" which generally have positive connotations. However, the initial phrase ""obviously a socialist commentary"" could imply a subjective perspective or bias, depending on the context in which ""socialist"" is used.

3. **Contextual Consideration**: The term ""socialist commentary"" might suggest a specific ideological perspective, which could be seen as subjective. However, the description of the commentary as ""informative, witty, and thought-provoking"" focuses on the qualities of the commentary rather than its ideological content. This suggests that the sentence is evaluating the commentary based on its merits as a piece of <ANS_START>objective<ANS_END>

[Question] as beacons of individuality in a sea of government conformity they represent freedom for those who own them .
[Answer] To classify the given sentence as subjective or objective, we will follow a step-by-step analysis based on the provided task description and instruction.

1. **Initial Assessment**: The sentence provided is ""as beacons of individuality in a sea of government conformity they represent freedom for those who own them."" The first step is to identify any explicit expressions of opinion or emotion within the sentence. Words like ""beacons,"" ""individuality,"" ""freedom"" have positive connotations and could indicate a subjective perspective.

2. **Tone Analysis**: Analyze the tone of the sentence to determine if it leans towards being positive, negative, or neutral. The use of ""beacons of individuality"" and ""represent freedom"" suggests a positive tone, which is often associated with subjective expressions. However, the context of ""government conformity"" introduces a contrast that might suggest a more nuanced or balanced view.

3. **Contextual Consideration**: Consider the context in which the sentence is used. The mention of ""government conformity"" versus ""individuality"" and ""freedom"" suggests a discussion about political or social systems. This context could imply a subjective stance, as discussions about political systems often involve personal opinions and biases.

4. **Objective vs. Subjective Elements**: Distinguish between <ANS_START>objective<ANS_END>

[Question] rather than spreading good cheer , the duo 's motive is to rob each establishment , a strategy that becomes complicated when they encounter an 8-year-old who teaches them the true meaning of christmas .
[Answer] To classify the given sentence as either subjective or objective, we will follow a step-by-step logical pathway that considers the language, tone, and context in which the sentence is used.

1. **Initial Assessment**: The sentence provided is ""rather than spreading good cheer, the duo's motive is to rob each establishment, a strategy that becomes complicated when they encounter an 8-year-old who teaches them the true meaning of Christmas."" The first step is to identify any overt expressions of opinion or emotion that could indicate subjectivity.

2. **Tone Analysis**: The tone of the sentence can be analyzed by looking at the words and phrases used. The phrase ""rather than spreading good cheer"" suggests a contrast between an expected positive action (spreading cheer) and the actual negative action (robbing). This contrast could imply a negative sentiment towards the duo's actions. However, the description of their actions (""rob each establishment"") is factual and does not inherently express a personal opinion.

3. **Contextual Consideration**: The context of the sentence involves a narrative about two individuals with a criminal intent (robbing establishments) and their interaction with an 8-year-old. The introduction of the 8-year-old teaching them the ""true meaning of Christmas"" suggests a potential shift in the <ANS_START>objective<ANS_END>

[Question] carol miller is a psychologist with a dark secret that prevents her making physical contact with other people .
[Answer] To classify the given sentence as subjective or objective, we will follow a step-by-step logical pathway that considers the language, tone, and context in which the sentence is used.

1. **Initial Assessment**: The sentence provided is ""carol miller is a psychologist with a dark secret that prevents her making physical contact with other people."" The first step is to identify any explicit expressions of opinion, emotion, or factual information within the sentence.

2. **Language Analysis**: The sentence contains the phrase ""dark secret,"" which could imply a negative or mysterious connotation. However, the presence of a ""dark secret"" does not necessarily make the sentence subjective, as it could be a factual description of a character's trait or backstory in a narrative.

3. **Tone Consideration**: The tone of the sentence seems neutral, as it simply states a fact about Carol Miller without expressing a clear opinion or emotion towards her condition or profession. The description of the secret as ""dark"" might suggest a slightly negative tone, but in the context of describing a character, this could be seen as a factual attribute rather than an expression of the author's opinion.

4. **Contextual Analysis**: Without additional context about the purpose of the sentence (e.g., whether it's from a book <ANS_START>objective<ANS_END>
