The objective is to discern sentences that rely on tangible proof from those that embody individual perspectives, potentially tainted by emotional nuances. To accomplish this, examine whether the sentence presents information that can be verified or invalidated, or if it articulates a personal stance, possibly infused with sentimental language. Classify the sentence as objective if it stems from verifiable facts and remains unbiased, or as subjective if it mirrors a personal viewpoint, emotional intonation, or language suggestive of opinion. Examine the sentence closely to differentiate between empirical data, which can be substantiated or refuted, and personal viewpoints, which reflect unique experiences or emotional responses. Categorize the sentence as 'objective' if it is grounded in factual data or 'subjective' if it is rooted in personal opinion. Determine the appropriate classification and enclose your response within the specified markers: <final_answer>answer</final_answer>, where 'answer' should be 'objective' if the sentence presents factual information or 'subjective' if it expresses a personal viewpoint, based on the presence of empirical evidence versus emotional or sentimental undertones.
