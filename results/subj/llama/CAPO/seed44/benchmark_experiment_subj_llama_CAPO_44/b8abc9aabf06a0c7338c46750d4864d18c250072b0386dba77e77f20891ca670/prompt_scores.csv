Input: a corrupt cia agent ( johnny depp ) who at that time , demands retribution from his worst enemy to carry out the drug lord 's uprising against the government .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To analyze the given sentence, we need to break it down into its components and assess the language used to determine its emotional tone and whether it expresses a personal viewpoint, emotional response, or biased judgment, or if it provides factual, unbiased data.

1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence describes a character, a ""corrupt CIA agent"" played by Johnny Depp, who is seeking ""retribution from his worst enemy"" to facilitate a ""drug lord's uprising against the government."" The use of the word ""corrupt"" already implies a negative judgment or bias against the character. The context of seeking retribution and being involved in a drug lord's uprising also carries a negative connotation, suggesting illegal and morally questionable activities.

2. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: The description of the CIA agent as ""corrupt"" and the involvement in illegal activities introduces a subjective judgment. The terms used are not neutral; they convey a negative opinion about the character's actions and morals. This subjectivity suggests that the sentence is not merely stating facts but is colored by the viewpoint of the speaker or writer.

3. **Emotional Tone**: The emotional tone of the sentence is negative, given the context of corruption, retribution, and illegal activities.

Input: after steve 's job opportunity in san francisco falls through , he comes up with a plan .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sentence ""after Steve's job opportunity in San Francisco falls through, he comes up with a plan"" can be analyzed for its emotional undertone. The phrase ""falls through"" has a slightly negative connotation, implying disappointment or failure. However, the sentence as a whole is more focused on stating a sequence of events rather than expressing a strong emotion. The tone is somewhat neutral, without explicit emotional language or biased wording. It presents a situation and a response to that situation in a straightforward manner. 

Given this analysis, the sentence is more objective than subjective because it reports on events without injecting a clear personal opinion or emotional perspective. It simply states what happens to Steve and his subsequent action.

Input: cold and scattered , minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals . that 's not vintage spielberg and that , finally , is minimally satisfying .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To analyze the tone of the provided sentence, let's break it down into its components:

1. ""cold and scattered"" - This phrase is subjective as it describes an emotional or qualitative assessment of something, likely the movie ""Minority Report.""
2. ""minority report commands interest almost solely as an exercise in gorgeous visuals"" - This statement, while focusing on a specific aspect of the movie (its visuals), implies a personal perspective on what makes the movie interesting. The use of ""almost solely"" suggests a limitation in the movie's appeal, which is a subjective judgment.
3. ""that's not vintage Spielberg"" - This is a subjective statement comparing the movie to the director's previous works, implying a personal expectation or standard for what constitutes ""vintage Spielberg.""
4. ""and that, finally, is minimally satisfying"" - This conclusion is subjective, as ""minimally satisfying"" expresses a personal sentiment regarding the movie's ability to meet expectations or provide enjoyment.

Given the analysis, the sentence is dominated by personal perspectives and emotional undertones rather than verifiable evidence. Therefore, it is categorized as subjective.

Input: anyone who can count to five ( the film 's target market ? ) can see where this dumbed-down concoction is going .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The tone of the provided sentence is critical and disapproving, with a hint of sarcasm. The use of the phrase ""dumbed-down concoction"" and the rhetorical question about the film's target market convey a negative personal opinion about the film. The statement ""anyone who can count to five... can see where this... is going"" is also subjective, as it implies that the outcome is obvious, but the obviousness is based on the speaker's personal perspective.

The sentence does not provide any verifiable evidence or objective facts about the film. Instead, it expresses a personal sentiment and emotional tone, which is negative and dismissive.

Input: this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wan na have fun into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To analyze the tone of the provided sentence, let's break it down:

1. **""this bold and lyrical first feature from raja amari""** - The use of ""bold"" and ""lyrical"" to describe the feature suggests a positive and artistic appreciation, which introduces a subjective element.
2. **""expands the pat notion that middle-aged women just wan na have fun""** - The phrase ""pat notion"" implies a common or oversimplified belief, and the casual expression ""just wan na have fun"" seems to undermine or simplify the complexity of the topic, which can be seen as subjective.
3. **""into a rousing treatise of sensual empowerment""** - The word ""rousing"" is positive and emotive, and ""treatise of sensual empowerment"" suggests a deep and possibly subjective interpretation of the theme of empowerment.

Given these observations, the sentence is more subjective than objective because it includes personal perspectives and emotional undertones through its choice of words and the way it frames the topic.

<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>

Input: the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To analyze the tone of the provided sentence, we need to break it down into its components and assess whether it presents verifiable evidence or personal perspectives/emotional undertones.

1. **""the script falls back on too many tried-and-true shenanigans""** - This part of the sentence suggests a criticism of the script's originality or lack thereof. The use of ""too many"" indicates a subjective judgment about the quantity of familiar plot devices or comedic elements. The phrase ""tried-and-true shenanigans"" is somewhat neutral but, in this context, implies a negative view of relying on familiar tropes.

2. **""that hardly distinguish it from the next teen comedy""** - This continuation emphasizes the lack of uniqueness or originality in the script by comparing it unfavorably to other teen comedies. The word ""hardly"" strengthens the subjective criticism, implying a significant lack of distinction.

Given this analysis, the sentence conveys a personal perspective or opinion about the script's quality and originality. It does not present verifiable evidence but rather an evaluation based on the writer's or speaker's subjective experience or standards of what constitutes original or engaging content in a teen comedy.

Input: three different scenarios , intercut , all using the same words but with very different meanings .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To assess the given sentence, let's break it down:

1. **Content**: The sentence discusses ""three different scenarios"" that are ""intercut"" and use ""the same words but with very different meanings."" This description implies an analysis or observation about how the same words can have different meanings based on the context or scenario in which they are used.

2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is descriptive and observational. It does not express a personal opinion or emotion directly but rather presents a situation or observation.

3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: The statement can be seen as objective because it describes a phenomenon (the use of the same words in different scenarios with different meanings) that can be observed and verified. It does not express a personal viewpoint or bias but rather states a fact about language usage that can be empirically observed.

4. **Empirical Evidence**: The phenomenon described can be supported by empirical evidence. For example, linguistic studies often examine how words' meanings change based on context, and this can be demonstrated through numerous examples across languages.

Given these considerations, the sentence is more aligned with objective observation than personal opinion, as it describes a verifiable aspect of language use without expressing a personal viewpoint.

Input: impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sentence provided conveys a comparison and an evaluation of a film's portrayal of human behavior, suggesting that it is more embracing than another entity referred to as ""monty."" The key elements to analyze here are the phrases ""impossible as it may sound,"" which introduces a subjective judgment, and ""this film's heart is even more embracing,"" which directly expresses an opinion about the film's nature. Furthermore, the sentence states that the film ""accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition,"" which, while it could be a factual description of the film's content, is framed within the context of a subjective evaluation of what makes the film's heart ""more embracing.""

Given these observations, the sentence embodies personal viewpoints and feelings about the film, comparing it to another entity (""monty"") in a manner that is not strictly factual but rather interpretative. The use of words like ""embracing"" to describe the film's portrayal of human flaws indicates a value judgment that is subjective.

This assessment is based on the critic's opinion of the film's quality and comedic value, using words like ""inept"" and ""tedious"" which convey a negative personal viewpoint. The use of ""almost enough chuckles for a three-minute sketch, and no more"" further emphasizes a subjective judgment on the film's ability to entertain. Since the statement reflects personal opinions and feelings about the film rather than presenting verifiable facts, it is not based on empirical evidence that can be universally verified.

Input: a very bizarre blend of reservoir dogs , fight club , unbreakable and croupier .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its language and content. The sentence describes a blend of different movies, which suggests a comparison or an opinion about the content or style of these films. The use of the word ""bizarre"" adds a subjective tone, as it expresses a personal viewpoint or impression rather than stating a factual characteristic.

Given this analysis, the sentence is classified as 'subjective' because it expresses a personal opinion or viewpoint about the movies mentioned, rather than providing factual information.

Input: wiseman is patient and uncompromising , letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its language and determine whether it presents factual information or expresses a personal viewpoint.

The sentence describes Wiseman as ""patient and uncompromising,"" which could be seen as subjective because these are qualities that can be perceived differently by different people. The phrase ""letting his camera observe and record the lives of women torn apart by a legacy of abuse"" is more factual in its description of the action but implies a subjective interpretation of the situation (""torn apart by a legacy of abuse"").

Given this analysis, the sentence can be classified as subjective because it expresses a viewpoint on Wiseman's character and the impact of abuse on women, rather than simply stating neutral, fact-based information.

To classify the given sentence, we need to analyze its content for emotional, personal opinions, or biases versus verifiable facts and data.

The sentence: """"

This sentence contains the following elements:
1. The novel's position on the best-seller list - This is a verifiable fact as it can be checked against current best-seller lists.
2. The mention of Hollywood's interest - This could be considered a fact if it's based on actual interest or announcements from Hollywood, but without specific details, it leans towards being a statement of potential or rumor.
3. The statement about the author's dedication to writing despite potential distractions - This part expresses a personal trait or behavior of the author, which could be seen as subjective as it reflects an opinion about the author's commitment.

Given these points, the sentence combines factual information (the novel's success) with a subjective interpretation of the author's dedication and the potential impact of Hollywood's interest.

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the sentiment of the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **Content**: The sentence describes a story setting involving a group of boys and girls trying to enjoy the end of summer before school resumes, facing comedic mishaps. This setup is narrative and does not express a personal opinion about the events but rather sets a scene.

2. **Tone**: The tone is light-hearted and suggests entertainment, indicated by the description of the tale as ""comic"" and the mention of ""comic mishappenings."" This tone is more aligned with storytelling than with expressing a personal viewpoint or emotion.

3. **Language**: The language used is descriptive and neutral, focusing on the plot of a story rather than evaluating or judging the characters' actions or the situation emotionally.

4. **Purpose**: The purpose appears to be informative about the plot of a story, aiming to engage or interest the reader in the narrative, rather than to persuade or express a personal opinion.

Given these considerations, the sentence is more about presenting a scenario or a story outline than about expressing a personal opinion or emotion. Therefore, it leans towards being a factual statement about the content of a story rather than a subjective expression of feelings or biases.

Input: after a really wild night jim and the gang wake up in an abandoned warehouse in a small town in the middle of no where , of which they have never heard of .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the sentiment of the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **""after a really wild night""** - This phrase suggests an exciting or unusual event occurred, which could be interpreted as a subjective experience since the term ""wild"" can vary greatly in meaning from person to person.
2. **""jim and the gang wake up in an abandoned warehouse""** - This part of the sentence describes a situation or event without expressing a clear opinion or emotion directly. It's more about what happened.
3. **""in a small town in the middle of no where""** - The use of ""no where"" (presumably ""nowhere"") is colloquial and subjective, as the perception of a place being in the middle of nowhere can vary greatly from person to person. It implies a sense of remoteness or isolation, which is a subjective interpretation.
4. **""of which they have never heard of""** - This indicates a lack of prior knowledge about the town, which is a factual statement about the characters' state of knowledge but doesn't express an opinion or emotion about the town itself.

Considering these points, the sentence combines elements of factual description (what happened, where they are) with subjective interpretations (

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the nature of the sentence's meaning, let's analyze its components:

1. **Emotional Tone**: The sentence starts with ""devastated,"" which is an emotional state. This indicates a personal feeling or reaction, suggesting a subjective element.
2. **Personal Stance**: The description of Philippa's actions and motivations (""tries to bring justice"") implies a personal stance or perspective, further indicating subjectivity.
3. **Biased Judgment**: The portrayal of the local police as ignoring her information could be seen as a judgment, which may also lean towards subjectivity.
4. **Factual Details**: The sentence includes specific, verifiable details such as the location (Turin, Italy), the profession of the character (British teacher), and the action taken by the character (trying to bring justice to a drug dealer). These details could be considered objective as they provide factual information.
5. **Purpose**: The purpose of the sentence appears to be informative, setting the scene for a story or plot. However, the inclusion of emotional and judgmental language influences the reader's perception, making it somewhat subjective.

Given these considerations, while the sentence contains factual elements, its overall tone, the inclusion of emotional states, and the implied judgment on the

Input: with the dog days of august upon us , think of this dog of a movie as the cinematic equivalent of high humidity .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the nature of the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence uses the phrase ""dog days of August,"" which is an idiomatic expression for the hottest and most humid period of the summer. It then metaphorically compares a movie to ""high humidity,"" suggesting discomfort or unpleasantness. The tone is clearly negative and critical, indicating a personal opinion rather than a neutral or factual report.

2. **Purpose**: The purpose of the sentence appears to be expressing a negative opinion about a movie, using a creative and somewhat humorous analogy to convey the writer's dissatisfaction. This is indicative of a subjective stance, as the evaluation of a movie's quality is inherently personal and can vary greatly from one individual to another.

3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: The sentence does not provide any factual, verifiable details about the movie, such as its plot, production quality, or reception. Instead, it offers a metaphorical comparison that reflects the writer's personal feelings towards the movie. This lack of empirical data and the presence of a clear emotional tone suggest that the sentence is subjective.

Given these considerations, the sentence is best categorized as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer>, as it reflects a personal

Input: with the help of a sexy and elusive young woman named bad girl ( king ) , they come together to do battle with the kung fu master who 'll stop at nothing to get the scroll .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the tone of the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **Use of Descriptive Language**: The sentence uses descriptive language such as ""sexy and elusive young woman"" and ""bad girl (king),"" which introduces a personal viewpoint on the character's appearance and possibly her personality. This kind of description can be seen as subjective because it reflects the speaker's or writer's perspective on what is attractive or intriguing.

2. **Emotional Undertone**: The description of the antagonist as a ""kung fu master who'll stop at nothing"" implies a sense of danger and urgency, introducing an emotional undertone to the narrative. This kind of phrasing can evoke feelings of tension or anticipation in the reader, which is a characteristic of subjective storytelling.

3. **Lack of Verifiable Data**: The sentence does not provide any verifiable data or empirical evidence. It is a narrative introduction that relies on character descriptions and action implications rather than factual information.

4. **Biased Judgment**: The use of terms like ""sexy,"" ""elusive,"" and ""bad girl"" can be seen as biased judgments about the character, reflecting the writer's or speaker's opinion rather than an objective assessment.

Input: is this dead visitor all in keith 's head or is she truly a mother ghost ?
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the tone of the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **Language and Imagery**: The sentence uses the phrase ""is this dead visitor all in Keith's head,"" which introduces an element of uncertainty and questioning regarding the reality of the situation. It also mentions ""a mother ghost,"" which is a supernatural entity, often associated with emotional, personal, or cultural beliefs rather than factual, scientific evidence.

2. **Intent Behind the Words**: The intent seems to be speculative, questioning the nature of a phenomenon (the appearance of a dead visitor or a mother ghost) and whether it is a product of Keith's imagination or an actual, possibly supernatural, event. This speculation about the nature of reality, especially concerning supernatural elements, tends to lean towards personal belief or interpretation rather than verifiable fact.

3. **Subjective vs. Objective**: The sentence does not present a verifiable, factual claim but rather poses a question about the interpretation of an experience. The experience itself (seeing a ghost) is not universally accepted as factual and varies greatly depending on personal beliefs, cultural background, and individual experiences. Therefore, the discussion about whether the ghost is ""all in Keith's head"" or ""truly a mother ghost"" involves personal sentiment

Input: but throughout these years , she keeps in touch with her mother via letters to prison .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the tone of the sentence ""but throughout these years, she keeps in touch with her mother via letters to prison,"" let's analyze its components:

1. **Language and Intent**: The sentence is stating a fact about a person's action (keeping in touch) and the method (via letters to prison). The phrase ""but throughout these years"" suggests a continuation or a contrast to a previous statement, which might imply a slight emotional undertone due to the context it's setting. However, the core of the sentence focuses on a factual action.

2. **Emotional Undertones**: While the situation described (a mother in prison and the daughter keeping in touch) can evoke emotions, the sentence itself does not express a personal sentiment or emotional appeal directly. It reports on an action without judgment or emotional language.

3. **Biased Viewpoints**: There's no apparent bias in the sentence. It does not take a stance or try to persuade the reader towards a particular viewpoint regarding the situation.

4. **Verifiable, Factual Content**: The action described (keeping in touch via letters) is something that can be verified. The sentence presents this action as a fact without expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the situation.

Given this analysis, the

Input: the two friends devise a plan to dress up in drag , commit a minor felony , get caught and then sent to the same prison in order to retrievie the ticket .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the tone of the given sentence, let's break it down:

1. **Content**: The sentence describes a plan involving dressing up in drag, committing a minor felony, getting caught, and being sent to prison to retrieve a ticket. This plan is unconventional and involves illegal activities, which already suggests a narrative or plot rather than a factual report.

2. **Language and Intent**: The language used is descriptive of a sequence of actions that are part of a plan. There's no emotional language or personal opinion expressed about the morality, feasibility, or desirability of the plan. The intent seems to be to convey a plot or a storyline rather than to persuade, criticize, or praise.

3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: 
   - **Subjective** sentences typically express personal opinions, emotions, or biases. They often include words or phrases that indicate a personal viewpoint or feeling.
   - **Objective** sentences, on the other hand, present verifiable information without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. They aim to inform or describe facts.

Given the context, the sentence appears to be describing a plot or a scenario, possibly from a story, without expressing any personal sentiment or emotional undertone regarding the actions described. It does not

The tone of the given sentence is critical and disapproving, indicating a personal opinion about the quality and excitement of the subject being discussed.

Input: sam mendes has become valedictorian at the school for soft landings and easy ways out .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the tone of the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **""sam mendes""** - This is a proper noun, referring to a person. The mention of a specific individual does not inherently lean towards subjectivity or objectivity.
2. **""has become valedictorian""** - This part of the sentence is factual. Becoming a valedictorian is an achievement based on academic performance, which can be verified through records.
3. **""at the school for soft landings and easy ways out""** - This part introduces a subjective element. The name ""school for soft landings and easy ways out"" does not sound like a real or traditional academic institution. It implies a judgment or opinion about the nature of the school, suggesting it might not be challenging or rigorous.

Given the analysis, the sentence mixes factual information (becoming valedictorian) with a subjective judgment (the nature of the school). However, the primary subjective element is the description of the school, which conveys a personal viewpoint or bias rather than presenting verifiable evidence about the school's academic standards or reputation.

Input: kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sentence ""kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that"" can be analyzed for its tone and content. The first part of the sentence states a fact about ""kung pow"" being a realization of Oedekerk's childhood dream, which could be considered objective information. However, the second part of the sentence, ""and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that,"" introduces a judgment or opinion about the outcome of Oedekerk's dream. This judgment is not a verifiable fact but rather a personal viewpoint or opinion on the success or appropriateness of realizing childhood dreams.

Given this analysis, the sentence as a whole is conveying a personal viewpoint, especially with the phrase ""should remain just that,"" which implies a value judgment on the part of the speaker. Therefore, the sentence is categorized as subjective because it includes a personal opinion or biased judgment.

The sentence provided expresses a personal viewpoint on the plotting of a film, indicating dissatisfaction and implying that the duration of the film, being around 90 minutes, is generally acceptable but not sufficient to redeem its plotting issues. The use of phrases like ""leaves a lot to be desired"" clearly conveys a subjective judgment rather than presenting factual, verifiable evidence. Therefore, the tone is subjective, reflecting the speaker's personal opinion or bias towards the film's plot.

These terms convey a negative opinion about the documentary in question, suggesting that it lacks depth, manipulates information, and employs sensationalist tactics. The use of such evaluative language indicates that the sentence is expressing a personal judgment rather than presenting neutral, factual information.

The sentence is analyzing a storyline and the intentions of its creator, Shyamalan, and it includes phrases like ""far bigger, far more meaningful story"" which indicate a personal interpretation of the story's depth and significance.

Input: set in the rugged mountains and lush , untamed forests of the pacific northwest , tribe of joseph is an engrossing tale of troubled youths plucked from the familiarity of their urban lives and transported into the alien isolation and life or death danger of a survivalist existence .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine whether the given sentence is subjective or objective, let's analyze its components:

1. **Setting Description**: The sentence starts with a descriptive description of the setting, ""set in the rugged mountains and lush, untamed forests of the Pacific Northwest."" This part of the sentence provides a factual backdrop for the story, as it describes geographical features that can be verified.

2. **Story Introduction**: It then introduces ""Tribe of Joseph"" as ""an engrossing tale,"" which begins to introduce a subjective element. The word ""engrossing"" implies an opinion about the quality or impact of the tale, suggesting that it is captivating or interesting. This is a subjective judgment because what one person finds engrossing, another might not.

3. **Plot Description**: The description of the plot, involving ""troubled youths"" being ""plucked from the familiarity of their urban lives"" into a survivalist existence, presents a scenario that could be either factual or fictional, depending on the context. However, the use of words like ""troubled"" and the dramatic description of their situation (""alien isolation and life or death danger"") introduces a subjective interpretation of the characters' experiences and the challenges they face.

Input: dildo diaries takes a lighthearted but 'probing ' approach to exploring the development of sections of the texas penal code and its effects on the adult sex toy industry .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **""Dildo Diaries""** - This is the title of a work, presumably a documentary, book, or similar, and does not in itself convey subjectivity or objectivity.
2. **""takes a lighthearted but 'probing' approach""** - The use of ""lighthearted"" and ""'probing'"" suggests a subjective interpretation of the approach taken by ""Dildo Diaries."" The word ""lighthearted"" especially implies a tone that is subjective, as what one person considers lighthearted, another might not.
3. **""to exploring the development of sections of the Texas Penal Code""** - This part of the sentence refers to a factual aspect, the exploration of legal code developments, which could be considered objective as it deals with verifiable information.
4. **""and its effects on the adult sex toy industry""** - Similar to the previous point, this part discusses the impact on an industry, which can be analyzed with factual data, suggesting an objective aspect.

However, the overall tone and the choice of words like ""lighthearted"" and ""'probing'"" introduce a

Input: three different scenarios , intercut , all using the same words but with very different meanings .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sentence ""three different scenarios, intercut, all using the same words but with very different meanings"" can be classified as <final_answer>objective</final_answer> because it describes a situation without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. It provides an observation about the use of words in different scenarios, which can be verified or observed, making it a factual statement rather than a subjective interpretation.

Input: its purpose is to use the precog ( nitive ) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **Content**: The sentence discusses the purpose of using the precognitive potential of genetically altered humans for a specific goal, which is to prevent murders. This goal is presented as a factual statement about the purpose of an initiative or program.

2. **Language and Tone**: The language used is straightforward and descriptive, focusing on the function or objective of a particular group or project. There's no emotional appeal, personal opinion, or bias evident in the statement.

3. **Verifiability**: While the concept of genetically altered humans with precognitive abilities is currently in the realm of science fiction, the sentence itself is structured as a factual statement about the purpose of such a program. If this were a real program, the statement about its purpose could be verified through documentation or official statements about the program's goals.

Given these considerations, the sentence is presenting information as a fact about the purpose of a program, without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. Therefore, it is classified as objective.

The sentence ""on the whole, the movie lacks wit, feeling and believability to compensate for its incessant coarseness and banality"" is subjective because it expresses a personal opinion about the movie, using words like ""lacks,"" ""coarseness,"" and ""banality,"" which convey a negative emotional tone and evaluation. The use of these words indicates that the statement is influenced by the speaker's personal feelings or biases towards the movie.

"Develop a classification system to categorize sentences into two distinct groups: subjective and objective. This entails scrutinizing the language and purpose of each sentence to discern whether it conveys a personal perspective or presents factual, unbiased information. The primary objective is to create a clear differentiation between sentences that are rooted in empirical evidence and those that are colored by individual emotions, beliefs, or biases. For each sentence, determine whether it belongs to the 'subjective' category, which is characterized by the presence of personal opinions or emotional undertones, or the 'objective' category, marked by a neutral, fact-based tone.

The primary objective is to discern between sentences that are rooted in empirical evidence and those that are shaped by individual perspectives or sentimental undertones. To achieve this, it is essential to evaluate each sentence and determine whether it is grounded in objective, verifiable data or if it reflects subjective interpretations, opinions, or emotional resonance. The classification process involves labeling each sentence as either 'subjective' to indicate the presence of personal opinions or biases, or 'objective' to denote a focus on factual, unbiased information.

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the given sentence, we must evaluate whether it presents information in a neutral, fact-based manner or if it embodies personal viewpoints, emotions, or biases.

The sentence ""three different scenarios, intercut, all using the same words but with very different meanings"" can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Content**: The sentence discusses the concept of different scenarios and the use of the same words with varying meanings. This concept is more about the structure or technique of storytelling or communication rather than expressing a personal opinion or emotion.
2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is descriptive and analytical, focusing on the method or technique of presenting scenarios rather than expressing a personal viewpoint or emotion.
3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: The sentence does not contain overt personal opinions, biases, or emotional undertones. It describes a situation or technique that can be observed or analyzed based on empirical evidence, such as in film, literature, or any form of storytelling.

Given these considerations, the sentence is more aligned with presenting information in a neutral, fact-based manner, as it describes a technique or phenomenon without expressing a personal opinion or bias.

To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its tone and content. The sentence ""three different scenarios, intercut, all using the same words but with very different meanings"" presents a description of a situation without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. It outlines a factual scenario involving the use of the same words in different contexts, which suggests a focus on the structure or concept rather than an emotional or personal perspective.

Given this analysis, the sentence is categorized based on its neutral tone and the absence of personal feelings or biases, focusing instead on describing a situation or concept. Therefore, the classification of the sentence is:

Input: this holds particularly true for blacky , a white teen who is more interested in books than sport , and his best friend , dumby , the aboriginal star of the team .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To evaluate the emotional tone and purpose of the provided sentence, let's break it down:

1. **Emotional Tone**: The sentence introduces two characters, ""blacky"" and ""dumby,"" with characteristics that could be seen as stereotypical or unusual based on the names and descriptions given. The tone seems somewhat informal and possibly narrative, setting up a story or scenario rather than presenting factual data.

2. **Purpose**: The purpose appears to be introductory, setting the stage for a story or discussion about these characters, possibly exploring themes of friendship, racial dynamics, or personal interests. The sentence does not seem to aim at conveying statistical data or factual information about broader groups based on race or interests.

3. **Bias and Perspective**: The choice of names (""blacky"" for a white teen and ""dumby"" for an Aboriginal star) could be seen as biased or stereotypical, suggesting a subjective perspective. The description of ""blacky"" being more interested in books than sports and ""dumby"" being the star of the team might reinforce certain stereotypes, indicating a subjective viewpoint.

4. **Sentiment Classification**: Given the narrative tone, the introduction of characters with potentially stereotypical descriptions, and the lack of factual data, the sentence leans towards being

It simply states that Steve's job opportunity fell through and that he then comes up with a plan, without any evaluative language that could suggest a biased perspective. The information given is neutral and does not include any personal feelings or opinions, focusing instead on a factual sequence of events. Therefore, the classification of the sentence's sentiment is:

The sentence provided conveys a negative opinion about the writer-director Stephen Gaghan, using a phrase that implies he has overcomplicated things to his own detriment. The use of the phrase ""near-fatal mistake"" and ""too clever by half"" introduces a critical tone, suggesting that the speaker does not approve of Gaghan's approach. This kind of language is indicative of personal judgment rather than a neutral or factual report. Therefore, the sentiment of the sentence is subjective, as it reflects the opinion or feeling of the speaker towards Gaghan's work.

The provided sentence contains a mix of historical events and emotional tone, making it subjective. The description of events such as blowing up a ship, deporting, and jailing refugees can be verified through historical records, which would be considered objective facts. However, the context and the way these events are presented, particularly the emphasis on ""jews"" and the overall negative portrayal, introduces a subjective perspective. The use of words like ""blow up"" and the focus on the treatment of specific groups can evoke emotions and suggests a personal opinion or bias against the actions described. Therefore, while the sentence includes verifiable historical data, its presentation and tone are subjective.

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The given sentence presents an evaluation of something based on its aesthetic appeal and comparison to specific cultural or artistic references (a farm implement on a restaurant wall, an Andy Warhol Mao poster). The use of the term ""kitsch appeal"" and the comparison to specific cultural icons indicates a personal viewpoint on what is considered interesting or aesthetically pleasing. The sentence does not provide empirical evidence or universally accepted facts to support its claims but rather expresses a personal opinion on the value and purpose of the subject in question.

The tone of the sentence is reflective of personal taste and cultural critique, which is inherently subjective. The comparison to specific cultural artifacts and the judgment of something being ""interesting, but not for its original purpose"" suggests a personal interpretation and evaluation rather than a factual, objective assessment.

Input: the acting is amateurish , the cinematography is atrocious , the direction is clumsy , the writing is insipid and the violence is at once luridly graphic and laughably unconvincing .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The given sentence is evaluative and critical, expressing strong negative opinions about various aspects of a film, including acting, cinematography, direction, writing, and violence. The use of words such as ""amateurish,"" ""atrocious,"" ""clumsy,"" ""insipid,"" ""luridly graphic,"" and ""laughably unconvincing"" indicates a personal judgment rather than a neutral, factual assessment. These terms reflect the writer's subjective experience and emotional response to the film, rather than providing an objective analysis based on empirical evidence or universally accepted criteria.

Input: impossible as it may sound , this film 's heart is even more embracing than monty , if only because it accepts nasty behavior and severe flaws as part of the human condition .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sentence presents information that is rooted in personal viewpoints and sentiments, as it expresses an opinion about the film's heart being ""even more embracing"" than another entity, and also makes a value judgment about the film's acceptance of ""nasty behavior and severe flaws"" as part of the human condition. The use of phrases such as ""impossible as it may sound"" and ""even more embracing"" also suggests a subjective tone, as they convey a personal perspective and emotional inclination. Therefore, the sentence's tone is subjective, as it expresses personal opinions and emotional inclinations rather than presenting impartial, factual data.

Input: gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sentence provided is making a comparison between the film ""Gangs"" and a ""good spaghetti western"" in terms of entertainment value. The use of the phrase ""as fun to watch"" introduces a subjective evaluation of the film's enjoyability, which can vary greatly from person to person. The comparison to a ""spaghetti western"" also implies a personal taste in film genres. Therefore, the sentence embodies personal viewpoints and sentiments rather than presenting impartial, factual data.

<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>

Input: ultimately , the message of trouble every day seems to be that all sexual desire disrupts life 's stasis .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To evaluate the given sentence, let's break it down:

1. **""the message of trouble every day""** - This part of the sentence suggests a theme or idea being conveyed, possibly from a specific source like a book, movie, or social context, but it's phrased in a way that implies interpretation.
2. **""seems to be""** - This phrase indicates a degree of uncertainty or a personal interpretation of the message, rather than a factual statement.
3. **""that all sexual desire disrupts life's stasis""** - This part presents an idea about the impact of sexual desire on stability or routine in life. The concept of ""disrupts life's stasis"" is an interpretation of how sexual desire affects life, which can vary greatly from person to person.

Given these points, the sentence is presenting an interpretation or perspective on the message of ""trouble every day"" and its relation to sexual desire and its impact on life. This interpretation is not universally applicable and can vary based on individual beliefs, experiences, and values.

<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>

Input: it is a dark comedy that challenges the traditional ideas of marriage and questions the societal values of money and sex .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To evaluate the given sentence, let's break it down:

1. **""it is a dark comedy""** - This part of the sentence can be considered objective if the classification of the comedy as ""dark"" is widely agreed upon or based on specific criteria that define dark comedies. However, the interpretation of what constitutes a dark comedy can vary, making this part somewhat subjective.

2. **""that challenges the traditional ideas of marriage""** - This statement can be seen as objective if it's verifiable that the content (likely a movie, play, or book) explicitly addresses and critiques traditional marriage concepts. However, the extent to which it ""challenges"" these ideas can be subjective and dependent on the viewer's or reader's perspective.

3. **""and questions the societal values of money and sex""** - Similar to the previous point, whether the content questions these values can be objective if it's a clear theme within the work. The interpretation of how these values are questioned, however, can vary from person to person.

Given these considerations, the sentence blends objective statements (the genre of the comedy and its themes) with subjective interpretations (how these themes are presented and perceived). The categorization of the sentence's content as a whole

Input: epic battles , spectacular effects and multiple story lines make the two towers a most excellent middle chapter in the lord of the rings film trilogy .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To evaluate the sentence, let's break it down into its components:

1. ""epic battles"" - This can be considered a subjective evaluation since what one person considers ""epic,"" another might not. It's an opinion about the quality or scale of the battles.
2. ""spectacular effects"" - Similar to ""epic battles,"" this is a subjective judgment about the quality of the special effects in the movie.
3. ""multiple story lines"" - This can be considered a verifiable fact. The Lord of the Rings film trilogy, specifically ""The Two Towers,"" does indeed have multiple story lines.
4. ""make the two towers a most excellent middle chapter"" - This is a subjective opinion. The use of ""most excellent"" indicates a personal judgment about the quality of the film as a middle chapter in the trilogy.

Given the analysis, the sentence contains both verifiable facts (""multiple story lines"") and personal opinions (""epic battles,"" ""spectacular effects,"" ""most excellent middle chapter""). However, the overall sentiment and evaluation of the film are subjective.

Input: it 's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sentence ""it's hard to believe that something so short could be so flabby"" expresses a personal opinion or subjective evaluation of something, likely a piece of writing, film, or other form of content. The use of the word ""flabby"" to describe the content is a value judgment that reflects the speaker's personal taste or opinion, rather than a verifiable fact. The phrase ""it's hard to believe"" also indicates a sense of surprise or incredulity, which is a subjective emotional response.

The sentence's emotional tone is negative, with words like ""boring"", ""pretentious"", ""whiny"", ""pathetic"", and ""untalented"" expressing a strong personal opinion.

The sentence provided contains phrases such as ""not a film to rival,"" ""fine little amuse-bouche,"" and ""keep your appetite whetted,"" which indicate a personal evaluation or opinion about the film. The use of ""fine little amuse-bouche"" is particularly subjective, as it expresses a positive, yet casual and somewhat whimsical, view of the film's quality and purpose.

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To evaluate the sentiment and purpose of the given sentence, let's break it down:

1. **Sentiment**: The sentence expresses a negative sentiment due to the context of death and the frustration with the local police. However, the primary focus is on conveying a situation rather than expressing a personal opinion about the events.

2. **Purpose**: The purpose of the sentence is to inform or describe a plot or situation, presumably from a movie or story, involving a character named Philippa and her actions following her husband's death.

3. **Subjective vs. Objective**: The sentence is primarily **objective** because it describes a sequence of events or a situation without expressing a personal opinion or bias towards those events. Although it involves emotional content (e.g., ""devastated""), this is used to set the context of the story rather than to persuade or express a personal viewpoint.

4. **Classification**: Given that the sentence aims to describe a situation without promoting a personal opinion or bias, it can be categorized as **objective**.

Input: he has just graduated college , he has a beautiful girlfriend , jane , and a publisher has picked up his first novel .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine whether the sentence conveys emotion or fact and categorize it accordingly, let's break it down:

1. ""he has just graduated college"" - This is a factual statement about an event that has occurred.
2. ""he has a beautiful girlfriend, jane"" - The description of Jane as ""beautiful"" introduces a subjective judgment, as beauty is in the eye of the beholder. However, the fact that he has a girlfriend named Jane can be considered factual.
3. ""and a publisher has picked up his first novel"" - This is also a factual statement about an event or situation.

Given the mix of factual information and a subjective evaluation (""beautiful""), the sentence overall contains elements of both objective fact and subjective opinion. However, the primary content of the sentence (graduation, having a girlfriend, and a publisher picking up his novel) can be verified and is thus factual. The subjective element (""beautiful"") is an adjective used to describe Jane but does not alter the factual nature of the events or relationships described.

Considering the overall content and purpose of the sentence, it leans more towards presenting factual information with a minor subjective descriptor. Therefore, the classification of the sentence, taking into account the context provided, would be more 'objective' due

Input: fontaine 's direction , especially her agreeably startling use of close-ups and her grace with a moving camera , creates sheerly cinematic appeal .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine whether the sentence conveys emotion or fact, let's break it down:

1. The sentence discusses Fontaine's direction and specific techniques she used, such as close-ups and moving camera work.
2. It describes these techniques as ""agreeably startling"" and states that they create ""sheerly cinematic appeal.""
   - The use of ""agreeably startling"" introduces a subjective judgment about the effect of the techniques.
   - ""Sheerly cinematic appeal"" also implies a value judgment on the aesthetic or artistic impact of the direction.

Given these points, the sentence includes evaluations and opinions about Fontaine's direction, indicating that it is not merely a factual report but includes personal sentiment or subjective evaluation.

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine whether the sentence conveys emotion or fact and categorize it accordingly, let's break it down:

1. **Content**: The sentence describes two individuals, their interests, and their ethnic backgrounds. It presents specific details about their personalities and hobbies without directly expressing a personal opinion or emotion about these characteristics.

2. **Language and Tone**: The language used is descriptive and informative. There's no overt emotional appeal or language that suggests a subjective judgment (e.g., words like ""amazing,"" ""wonderful,"" ""terrible"") that would typically indicate a personal sentiment.

3. **Purpose**: The purpose appears to be informative, aiming to introduce characters and their traits rather than to persuade or evoke an emotional response from the reader.

Given these considerations, the sentence is primarily presenting information about the characters without expressing a personal opinion or emotion. Therefore, it is categorized as a presentation of factual information.

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine whether the sentence conveys emotion or fact and categorize it accordingly, let's analyze its components:

1. **Historical Context**: The sentence mentions a specific time period (""in the 1870s"") and a geographical location (""southern Brazil""), which suggests a factual setup.
2. **Biographical Information**: It introduces a character, ""Jacobina,"" who is described in relation to her parents (""daughter of German immigrants""), providing more factual background.
3. **Action Description**: The sentence describes Jacobina's actions (""starts to break with both the Catholic and Lutheran churches to preach body healing through soul cleansing""), which can be seen as a factual account of her activities, even though the subject matter involves religious beliefs and practices.

Given these observations, the sentence primarily presents historical and biographical information without expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the events or Jacobina's beliefs. It reports on actions and circumstances in a neutral manner, aiming to inform rather than persuade or evoke an emotional response.

The use of the phrase ""typical Hollywood disregard"" suggests a preconceived notion or bias against Hollywood's approach to historical topics. Furthermore, the mention of finding entertainment in the experiences of certain characters implies a subjective evaluation of the content's enjoyability. The tone is not purely factual but rather opinionated, as it reflects the speaker's feelings and attitudes towards the subject matter.

<final_answer> subjective </final_answer>

Input: a murder in the camp gives him the chance to set a risky plan in motion .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To assess the tone of the given sentence, ""a murder in the camp gives him the chance to set a risky plan in motion,"" let's break it down:

1. **Neutral, Unbiased Manner**: The sentence reports an event (a murder) and its consequence (setting a plan in motion) without directly expressing a personal opinion or emotion about the event itself. It does not contain overtly emotional language or value judgments.

2. **Objective, Factual Content vs. Sentiment**: The language used is straightforward and descriptive of actions and their consequences. The term ""risky"" could be seen as slightly evaluative, implying a judgment about the plan, but in the context of setting a plan in motion following a significant and presumably disruptive event like a murder, ""risky"" can also be seen as a factual assessment of the situation's potential outcomes.

3. **Tone Assessment**: The tone is primarily informative, aiming to convey what happens as a result of the murder. While the word ""risky"" introduces a slight element of interpretation, the overall sentence structure and choice of words do not convey a strong emotional appeal or personal perspective.

Given these considerations, the sentence can be classified as more **objective** than subjective because it primarily reports

Input: evokes the frustration , the awkwardness and the euphoria of growing up , without relying on the usual tropes .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To assess the tone of the given sentence, let's break it down:

1. **Language and Tone**: The sentence uses words like ""frustration,"" ""awkwardness,"" and ""euphoria,"" which are emotional states. This indicates that the sentence is describing a personal or emotional experience rather than a purely factual one.

2. **Subjectivity**: The use of the word ""usual tropes"" suggests a judgment or opinion about common portrayals of growing up, implying that the speaker or writer has a perspective on what is typical or clichéd. This further suggests subjectivity.

3. **Objective vs. Subjective Content**: While the sentence does describe a universal experience (growing up), the way it's framed (focusing on emotions and criticizing common portrayals) introduces a personal perspective. Objective content would likely focus on factual aspects of growing up without emotional judgment.

Given these observations, the sentence embodies personal perspectives and emotions, using language that reflects sentiment rather than purely factual, objective content.

Input: just teetering south of puberty , young thomas harris has discovered that instead of looking at stars , he can use his new telescope to study the beautiful woman next door .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To assess the given sentence, let's break it down into its components and analyze its nature:

1. **Content Description**: The sentence describes a scene involving a young character, Thomas Harris, and his use of a telescope. It mentions his age relative to puberty and his choice of using the telescope to observe a neighbor rather than astronomical objects.

2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is narrative and descriptive, setting a scene that could be part of a story. The tone seems to be observational and slightly humorous, given the unexpected use of the telescope.

3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: 
   - **Objective** statements are typically based on verifiable evidence, quantifiable data, and are less likely to change based on the observer's perspective. They aim to report facts without personal bias.
   - **Subjective** statements, on the other hand, reflect personal opinions, feelings, or biases. They can vary greatly from person to person and are often influenced by individual experiences, emotions, and perspectives.

Given these considerations, the sentence ""just teetering south of puberty, young Thomas Harris has discovered that instead of looking at stars, he can use his new telescope to study the beautiful woman next door"" is more aligned with

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The given sentence expresses a negative opinion about the Merchant-Ivory team and their impact on cinema. The use of strong language such as ""systematically destroy"" and ""do even more damage"" indicates a personal assessment rather than a neutral, factual report. The statement reflects the speaker's emotional perspective and subjective evaluation of the team's work, rather than presenting verifiable, empirical data.

Input: naxalites are becoming more and more popular among tribles because of their capacity to give instant justice and more and more youths are joining them .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To assess the given sentence, let's break it down:

1. **""Naxalites are becoming more and more popular among tribles""** - This part of the statement could be considered subjective because the term ""popular"" can be perceived differently by various individuals. Popularity can be measured in various ways, including the number of supporters, the level of influence, or the frequency of positive mentions in media or community discussions. However, without specific, quantifiable data, the claim of increasing popularity remains subjective.

2. **""because of their capacity to give instant justice""** - This reason provided for the Naxalites' popularity introduces a subjective judgment. The concept of ""instant justice"" can vary greatly depending on individual perspectives and values. What one person considers justice, another might not. This part of the statement reflects a value judgment rather than an objective fact.

3. **""and more and more youths are joining them""** - Similar to the first part, the claim that ""more and more youths are joining them"" could be subjective without concrete, empirical evidence. It implies an increase in membership among youths, but without specific numbers or data, it's difficult to verify the extent of this trend.

Given these considerations, the statement

Input: 'the chM-bteau is never quite able to overcome the cultural moat surrounding its ludicrous and contrived plot . '
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The given sentence expresses a critical evaluation of a film, likely ""chM-bteau,"" which seems to be a typographical error and possibly refers to a specific movie title. The use of words like ""ludicrous,"" ""contrived,"" and the phrase ""cultural moat"" indicates a strong opinion about the plot's credibility and the film's ability to transcend cultural barriers. This kind of language suggests that the statement is based on personal judgment rather than factual, empirical evidence. The criticism of the plot as ""ludicrous and contrived"" is a subjective interpretation that may vary from person to person, depending on individual tastes and cultural backgrounds.

The given sentence expresses a negative opinion about a directing debut, using words like ""beyond-lame"", ""pitiful"", which are subjective and emotive. The language used is critical and disapproving, indicating a personal viewpoint rather than a factual report. The tone is also informal and evaluative, suggesting that the statement is based on personal taste rather than objective criteria.

Input: if you 're part of her targeted audience , you 'll cheer . otherwise , maybe .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The given sentence expresses a conditional reaction to someone's performance or action, which depends on the audience's relationship with the person in question. The use of ""you'll cheer"" and ""otherwise, maybe"" indicates a personal and variable response based on individual perspectives or feelings towards the person. This suggests that the sentence is conveying an emotive perspective rather than presenting verifiable evidence.

Given this analysis, the sentence is best categorized as a personal viewpoint because it discusses potential reactions based on personal connections or feelings rather than providing factual information.

The use of phrases such as ""too cerebral for its own good"" and ""too cerebral for its racy subject matter"" indicate a subjective evaluation of the subject's balance between intellectual depth and its provocative content. These judgments are based on personal taste and critical perspective rather than on verifiable facts.

The given sentence is an analysis of Christopher Hitchens' perspective on Henry Kissinger, but it is phrased in a way that conveys the opinion of the speaker rather than presenting verifiable evidence. The use of phrases such as ""one is left with the inescapable conclusion"" and ""a sophisticated flower child's desire to purge the world of the tooth and claw of human power"" suggests a personal interpretation or viewpoint. The language used is emotive and interpretive, indicating that the statement is more of a subjective analysis than an objective report.

Input: the values that have held the enterprise crew together through previous adventures and perils do so again-courage , self-sacrifice and patience under pressure .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The given sentence expresses an evaluation of the values that have helped the enterprise crew in their adventures, highlighting courage, self-sacrifice, and patience under pressure. This evaluation is based on the narrator's interpretation of the crew's behavior and the significance of these values, rather than on quantifiable data or empirical evidence. The use of words like ""courage"" and ""self-sacrifice"" implies a level of subjective judgment about what constitutes admirable or effective behavior under challenging circumstances.

Given this analysis, the sentence is more aligned with a personal viewpoint, as it reflects an assessment or opinion about the crew's values and their impact, rather than presenting verifiable facts or data. Therefore, the classification of the sentence would be subjective, as it is influenced by the perspective or opinion of the narrator.

Input: a faction of political separatists , led by count dooku , attempts to assassinate her .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the nature of the sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **Content**: The sentence describes an event involving a faction of political separatists and an attempt to assassinate a person, presumably a public or political figure, given the context of separatists and the involvement of Count Dooku, a character known from the Star Wars universe for his political and military roles.

2. **Empirical Evidence and Observable Facts**: The sentence presents a scenario that could be part of a narrative, historical account, or fictional story. Without additional context, it's difficult to ascertain if this event is based on real historical events or is part of a fictional universe. However, given the mention of Count Dooku, who is a character from the Star Wars franchise, it's reasonable to infer that this sentence is describing a fictional event.

3. **Personal Stance, Emotional Tone, or Inherent Bias**: The sentence itself does not express a personal opinion, emotion, or bias. It reports an action taken by a group in a neutral manner without evaluating the morality or justification of the action.

4. **Classification**: Since the sentence describes a specific event without expressing a personal opinion, emotion, or bias, and considering it's based on a fictional character

The sentence conveys a personal viewpoint or emotion, as it expresses a negative opinion about the movie, using words like ""lacks"", ""coarseness"", and ""banality"" that reflect the speaker's subjective evaluation.

Input: in 1999 , after one of their husbands became ill with leukemia , the women came up with a more commercial concept : discreet photos of these bare wi lasses .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To assess the sentiment of the given sentence, it's essential to break down its components and analyze the nature of the information presented. The sentence discusses a specific event involving a group of women and their response to a personal situation, namely, one of their husbands becoming ill with leukemia. This event led to the women coming up with a more commercial concept involving discreet photos.

The key elements to consider in determining the sentiment and nature of the sentence are:

1. **Factual Information**: The sentence provides specific, verifiable details such as the year (1999) and the illness (leukemia), which are objective facts.
2. **Personal or Emotional Context**: The situation described involves personal circumstances (a husband becoming ill) and the women's response to it, which introduces an element of personal viewpoint or emotion.
3. **Commercial Concept**: The mention of the women coming up with a ""more commercial concept"" suggests a business or entrepreneurial decision, which, while influenced by personal circumstances, is presented in a factual manner.

Given these considerations, the sentence primarily conveys information that can be verified (the year, the illness, the action taken by the women) but is set against a backdrop of personal circumstances. However, the overall presentation of the information does

Input: he discovers that his daughter 's life , unknown to him from an affair with a brazilian woman 15 years earlier , is in danger and must return to rio ; having only five days to finish the deal and find his daughter .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the sentiment of the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. The sentence describes a plot or situation involving a character's personal life and emotions, indicating elements of a personal viewpoint.
2. It mentions specific events and circumstances (an affair, a daughter in danger, a time constraint) that could be part of a narrative or story, suggesting a presentation of information that is part of a fictional or personal context rather than verifiable, factual data.
3. The sentence does not express a clear opinion or emotion directly but sets up a scenario that could evoke emotions or opinions in a reader or viewer, depending on the context in which it's presented.

Given these considerations, the sentence seems to present a scenario that is part of a story or narrative, which typically involves personal viewpoints or emotional elements, even if the sentence itself does not directly express an opinion. However, since it describes a situation without expressing a direct opinion or emotion about the situation, it could be seen as setting up a scenario rather than stating a personal viewpoint. But considering the context of categorization for sentiment analysis, which often looks for the presence of personal opinions or emotions, and given that this sentence describes a personal and emotional situation, it leans towards being subjective in the context of

Input: `` on guard ! `` wo n't be placed in the pantheon of the best of the swashbucklers but it is a whole lot of fun and you get to see the one of the world 's best actors , daniel auteuil , have a whale of a good time .

The given sentence expresses a personal opinion about the movie ""On Guard"" and its entertainment value, as well as the performance of the actor Daniel Auteuil. The use of phrases such as ""a whole lot of fun"" and ""have a whale of a good time"" indicate a subjective evaluation. Therefore, the sentence is subjective.

Input: an ancient tablet found by famous british archaeologist professor hyde-white is believed to be a roadmap to the legendary lost temple of faramundi and its hidden treasures .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the sentiment of the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **""an ancient tablet found by famous British archaeologist Professor Hyde-White""** - This part of the sentence provides information about an event (the discovery of a tablet) and the person involved (Professor Hyde-White). The description of the archaeologist as ""famous"" could introduce a subjective element, but in the context of the sentence, it primarily serves to establish the credibility or significance of the discovery rather than express a personal viewpoint.

2. **""is believed to be a roadmap to the legendary lost temple of Faramundi and its hidden treasures""** - The phrase ""is believed to be"" indicates that the status of the tablet as a roadmap is not a fact but rather an interpretation or hypothesis. The belief could be based on expert opinion or evidence, but it introduces an element of subjectivity because beliefs can vary among individuals. However, the sentence does not express a personal emotion or viewpoint of the speaker; it reports on a belief presumably held by others (possibly experts or the archaeologist).

Given this analysis, while the sentence contains elements that could be considered subjective (the interpretation of the tablet's significance, the belief in its purpose), it primarily presents

Input: it is best appreciated as an immersion in a three-dimensional toyland outfitted with enough whimsical gadgetry to fill a thousand playrooms .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sentence provided conveys a personal viewpoint or emotion, as it describes something being ""best appreciated"" in a specific manner, which is a subjective evaluation. The use of words like ""whimsical"" also adds to the subjective nature of the sentence, as it expresses a personal or emotional response to the described environment.

Input: emma 's a succesful sale agent for a home security company , due in part to being the police chief 's daughter .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the sentiment of the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. The sentence mentions ""emma"" as a successful sales agent, which is a factual statement about her profession.
2. It attributes her success ""due in part to being the police chief's daughter,"" which introduces an element of potential bias or advantage due to her personal connection.

Given these points, the sentence presents information that can be verified (Emma's profession and her relationship to the police chief), but it also implies a personal viewpoint or emotion by suggesting that her success is partly due to her family connection, which could be seen as an opinion on the nature of her success.

However, the core information (her job and her father's position) is verifiable, making the sentence more objective in nature, as it reports on facts rather than expressing a clear emotion or personal viewpoint directly.

Input: shot on wide screen digibeta , sendak with his night kitchen theater partner , arthur yorinks and pilobolus artistic directors robby barnett , michael tracy , and jonathan wolken shows us the tenacity and wit that drive the creative process when serious artists work together .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To analyze the given sentence, we need to break it down and examine its components for neutrality, facts, opinions, or emotions.

1. **""shot on wide screen digibeta""** - This part of the sentence provides technical information about the format used for filming. It is factual and does not express any opinion or emotion.

2. **""sendak with his night kitchen theater partner, arthur yorinks and pilobolus artistic directors robby barnett, michael tracy, and jonathan wolken""** - This segment introduces individuals involved in a project, likely a theatrical or dance production, given the mention of ""night kitchen theater"" and ""pilobolus artistic directors."" It provides names and roles, which are factual.

3. **""shows us the tenacity and wit that drive the creative process when serious artists work together""** - This part of the sentence describes the outcome or the nature of the collaboration among these artists. The use of the words ""tenacity"" and ""wit"" to describe the creative process introduces a subjective interpretation. ""Tenacity"" and ""wit"" are positive attributes that reflect an opinion about the quality of the collaboration and the artists involved.

Given the analysis, the sentence combines

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To analyze the given sentence, we need to identify whether it presents information in a neutral, factual manner or conveys personal views and emotions.

The sentence includes phrases such as ""a whole lot of fun"" and ""have a whale of a good time,"" which indicate personal enjoyment and enthusiasm. Additionally, the statement ""one of the world's best actors"" is an opinion, as the ranking of actors can vary based on individual perspectives.

Given these observations, the sentence conveys personal views and sentiments rather than presenting information in a purely neutral, factual manner.

Input: after steve 's job opportunity in san francisco falls through , he comes up with a plan .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine whether the sentence is subjective or objective, let's analyze its components:

1. **""after steve 's job opportunity in san francisco falls through""** - This part of the sentence provides a factual setup for the story. It states an event (a job opportunity falling through) without expressing a judgment or emotion about the event itself. However, the phrase ""falls through"" can slightly imply a negative outcome, but in the context of setting up a narrative, it's more about the event than an emotional judgment.

2. **""he comes up with a plan""** - This part indicates an action taken by Steve as a response to the previous event. It's a factual statement about an action without expressing an opinion about the quality, feasibility, or emotional implications of the plan.

Given these observations, the sentence primarily reports on events and actions without expressing a personal view or emotion about those events. It does not contain overt opinions, sentiments, or emotional language that would categorize it as subjective. Therefore, it presents information in a neutral, factual manner.

<final_answer>objective</final_answer>

Input: he discovers that his daughter 's life , unknown to him from an affair with a brazilian woman 15 years earlier , is in danger and must return to rio ; having only five days to finish the deal and find his daughter .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To analyze the given sentence, let's break it down:

1. **Content**: The sentence describes a plot or situation involving a character who has a personal connection (a daughter from an affair) and is facing a time-sensitive challenge (finding his daughter and completing a deal within five days). The elements of danger, personal relationships, and urgency are typical of narrative structures found in fiction or personal stories.

2. **Tone and Language**: The language used (""discovers,"" ""life in danger,"" ""must return"") suggests a sense of urgency and importance, which is often indicative of a narrative designed to engage the reader or viewer emotionally. There's no overt emotional language (like ""tragically"" or ""happily""), but the situation itself evokes a sense of tension or concern.

3. **Subjectivity vs. Objectivity**: 
   - **Objective** information would typically be verifiable, factual, and not dependent on personal feelings, interpretations, or prejudices. It presents information as it is, without adding a personal perspective.
   - **Subjective** information, on the other hand, involves personal opinions, feelings, or biases. It's about how someone perceives or interprets a situation, which can vary greatly from person to person

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its components and tone:

1. **Content**: The sentence discusses historical figures (Spielrein, Freud, and Jung) and their correspondence, which is a factual, verifiable aspect of history. It also mentions the evolution of psychoanalysis and challenges faced by women, which are topics that can be supported by evidence.

2. **Tone and Language**: The language used is informative and does not express a personal opinion or emotion regarding the individuals or the topic of psychoanalysis. The phrase ""virtually insurmountable challenges"" could be seen as slightly emotive, but in the context of historical fact, it's more descriptive of the obstacles faced by women rather than an expression of the author's sentiment.

3. **Objectivity**: The sentence aims to inform about a historical discovery and its significance in understanding psychoanalysis and the challenges women faced in the field. It does not contain overt personal judgments, opinions, or biases that would categorize it as subjective.

4. **Subjectivity**: While the sentence is generally factual, the description of challenges as ""virtually insurmountable"" introduces a slight subjective element, as it characterizes the degree of difficulty faced by women. However, this characterization

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its components and tone:

1. **Factual Elements**: The sentence mentions ""Area K,"" a specific geographical or administrative designation, and its role as an ""Israeli controlled marine zone."" This part of the sentence can be verified through factual records or official documents, indicating a level of objectivity.

2. **Description of Function**: It describes Area K as isolating the Gaza Strip and preventing Palestinian fishermen from entering Israel, Egypt, and international waters. This description can be seen as factual, as it outlines the purpose or effect of the marine zone, which can be confirmed through reports, maps, or official statements.

3. **Potential for Bias**: The sentence could be perceived as having a slight negative undertone towards Israel due to the use of the word ""preventing,"" which might imply a restriction or a negative action. However, the primary focus of the sentence is on describing a situation rather than making a value judgment.

4. **Lack of Emotional Language**: The sentence does not contain overtly emotional language or personal opinions. It sticks to describing a situation without using words that would clearly indicate a subjective viewpoint, such as ""unjustly,"" ""cruelly,"" or ""wisely.""

Input: kung pow is oedekerk 's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the tone of the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **""kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick""** - This part of the sentence provides information about the movie ""Kung Pow"" and its relation to Oedekerk's childhood dream. It can be seen as a factual statement about the background or inspiration behind the movie.

2. **""and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that""** - This part introduces a judgment or opinion about the outcome of realizing one's childhood dreams, specifically in the context of the movie ""Kung Pow"". The phrase ""should remain just that"" implies a value judgment on whether certain dreams should be pursued or left as mere aspirations. This judgment is subjective because it reflects a personal viewpoint on the desirability of pursuing childhood dreams.

Given the analysis, the sentence contains both factual information (about the movie and its inspiration) and a subjective opinion (about the wisdom of pursuing childhood dreams). However, the overall tone and the second part of the sentence clearly express a personal opinion or viewpoint, which makes the sentence subjective.

Input: what they do n't know , however , is that they 're filming near the secret hideout of slobodan pavle , a serbian war criminal .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To determine the tone of the given sentence, let's analyze its components. The sentence mentions a specific individual, Slobodan Pavle, referred to as a ""Serbian war criminal."" This part of the sentence is based on factual information, as it identifies a person and his alleged role or actions. However, the context in which this information is presented, including the mention of a ""secret hideout,"" suggests a narrative or storytelling element that could be part of a fictional story, documentary, or news report.

The key elements to consider are:
1. **Factual Information**: The sentence contains the name of an individual and his designation as a ""Serbian war criminal,"" which could be verified through historical or legal records.
2. **Contextual Presentation**: The way this information is presented, especially the mention of a ""secret hideout,"" could imply a narrative or dramatic context, which might suggest a subjective interpretation of events or a specific perspective on the individual and his actions.

Given these considerations, the sentence itself, when taken at face value, provides information that could be verified (the existence of a person named Slobodan Pavle and his involvement in criminal activities). However, the context in which this information is presented (e.g.,

"To efficiently distinguish between factual and opinion-based sentences, we aim to sort them into two categories: objective sentences that provide unbiased, evidence-supported information, and subjective sentences that convey personal feelings, opinions, or biases. The task involves evaluating each sentence to ascertain whether it relies on concrete, factual data or if it's swayed by individual emotions, beliefs, or perspectives. The classification of each sentence as either 'subjective' or 'objective' should be clearly indicated within the <final_answer> tags, facilitating a rapid differentiation between impartial, factually accurate sentences and those that express personal viewpoints or emotional undertones, with the classification explicitly stated as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> or <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for easy identification.

Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

The sentence provided is: ""ultimately the project comes across as clinical, detached, uninvolving, possibly prompting audience members to wonder, 'what's the point?'""

This sentence can be classified as <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> because it expresses a personal viewpoint or opinion about the project. The use of words like ""clinical,"" ""detached,"" and ""uninvolving"" convey a negative emotional tone and imply a personal judgment about the project's impact on its audience. The phrase ""possibly prompting audience members to wonder, 'what's the point?'"" further suggests a subjective interpretation of how the audience might react, rather than stating an objective fact.

Place your classification between the <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.

Input: a story about a troubled genius who attempts to build a magnetic engine in hopes of greatly reducing the worlds consumption of fossil fuels and electricity .
Output: <|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

To classify the given sentence, let's analyze its components:

1. **""a story about a troubled genius""** - This part introduces a character with a subjective label (""troubled genius""), which implies a certain level of interpretation or judgment about the character's state or abilities. The term ""genius"" is particularly subjective, as it is an evaluation of someone's intellectual abilities or creativity.

2. **""attempts to build a magnetic engine""** - This action is presented as a factual event within the context of the story. It describes what the character is doing without expressing a judgment about the feasibility, practicality, or morality of the action.

3. **""in hopes of greatly reducing the world's consumption of fossil fuels and electricity""** - This part expresses a motivation or goal. The use of ""in hopes"" suggests an intention or desire, which is subjective, as it reflects the character's personal wishes or beliefs about what would be beneficial.

Considering these points, the sentence combines elements of objective description (the action of attempting to build a magnetic engine) with subjective interpretations (the characterization of the protagonist as a ""troubled genius"" and the expression of their hopes). However, the overall presentation is more aligned with subjective storytelling
