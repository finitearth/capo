For each premise in the dataset, use your knowledge of cause and effect to decide which of the two choices (A or B) is more likely to follow from the premise. Scrutinize the premise and employ your reasoning skills to determine which alternative is more likely to be the result. Use your commonsense reasoning to assess the logical connection between the premise and each option. Based on your understanding of causal relationships, pick the option that best signifies the effect. Indicate your choice by placing it between the markers <final_answer>A</final_answer> or <final_answer>B</final_answer>, depending on which option you think has the stronger causal link to the premise.
