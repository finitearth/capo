[Question] The athlete got a sprained ankle.
cause A: The athlete slipped on the ice.
cause B: The athlete was hit by a ball.
[Answer] To determine the correct effect of the premise ""The athlete got a sprained ankle,"" we need to analyze the given causes and determine which one is the most likely cause of the sprained ankle.

### Reasoning Chain:

1. **Identify the Premise:**
   - The premise is ""The athlete got a sprained ankle.""

2. ** Analyze the Causes:
   - **Cause A:** The athlete slipped on the ice.
   - **Cause B: The athlete was hit by a ball.

   - **Cause A: Slipping on the ice** is a common cause of sprained ankles. Slipping can lead to sudden and abrupt movements, which can cause the ankle to twist and sprain.
   - **Cause B: Being hit by a ball** can also cause a sprained ankle, but it is less common and less likely to result in a sprain compared to slipping on ice.

4. ** Determine the most likely cause:
   - Based on the analysis, slipping on the ice is more likely to cause a sprained ankle.

5. ** Conclusion:
   - The most likely cause of the sprained ankle is slipping on the ice.
