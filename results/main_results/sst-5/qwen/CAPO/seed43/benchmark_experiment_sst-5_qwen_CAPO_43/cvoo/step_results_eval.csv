To determine the sentiment of the film review, let's break down the key phrases and their implications:

1. ""occasionally loud and offensive"" - This suggests some negative aspects of the film, but the use of ""occasionally"" implies it's not a constant issue.
2. ""but more often, it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma"" - This part is more negative, as it suggests the film is boring or unengaging for most of its duration.

Considering these points, the review leans towards a negative sentiment, but it's not extremely harsh or critical. Therefore, the sentiment is negative but not very negative.

1. ""occasionally loud and offensive"" - This suggests some negative aspects of the film, but the use of ""occasionally"" implies it's not a constant issue.
2. ""but more often, it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma"" - This part is more negative, as it suggests the film is boring or unengaging for most of its duration.

To determine the sentiment of the film review, let's break down the key phrases and their implications:

1. ""occasionally loud and offensive"" - This suggests some negative aspects of the film, but the use of ""occasionally"" implies it's not a constant issue.
2. ""but more often, it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma"" - This part is more negative, as it suggests the film is boring or unengaging for most of its duration.

Considering these points, the review leans towards a negative sentiment, but it's not extremely harsh or critical. Therefore, the sentiment is negative but not very negative.

To determine the sentiment of the film review, let's break down the key phrases and their implications:

1. ""occasionally loud and offensive"" - This suggests some negative aspects of the film, but the use of ""occasionally"" implies it's not a constant issue.
2. ""but more often, it simply lulls you into a gentle waking coma"" - This part is more negative, as it suggests the film is boring or unengaging for most of its duration.

Considering these points, the review leans towards a negative sentiment, but it's not extremely harsh or critical. Therefore, the sentiment is negative but not very negative.
