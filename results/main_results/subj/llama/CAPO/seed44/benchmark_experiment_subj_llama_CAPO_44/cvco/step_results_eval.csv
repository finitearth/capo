Your mission is to scrutinize each sentence's linguistic characteristics, tone, and substance to ascertain whether it embodies a factual, data-driven account or a personalized, opinionated perspective. The classification process involves labeling each sentence as either an objective statement, grounded in empirical reality and open to verification, or a subjective expression, reflective of individual sentiments, biases, or convictions. When you've made your determination, respond with the classification outcome, utilizing <final_answer>objective</final_answer> for sentences that adhere to verifiable facts and empirical data, and <final_answer>subjective</final_answer> for sentences that convey personal opinions, emotions, or partialities, effectively distinguishing between sentences that report verifiable information and those that encapsulate individual viewpoints or feelings.
