To tackle the problem of classifying news articles into four categories, we can develop a series of experiments. First, we can use a simple text classification model to classify the news articles. We can use a pre-trained model like BERT or RoBERTa to classify the news articles. We can measure progress by calculating the accuracy of the model. We can simplify the problem by reducing the number of categories to two. We can assume that the news articles are written in English. We can also assume that the news articles are written in a standard format.

Please read this news article carefully and assign it to one of these four categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. Your answer must be formatted as <final_answer>category</final_answer>.
