To tackle the problem of classifying news articles into four categories, we can develop a series of experiments. First, we can use a simple text classification model to classify the news articles. We can use a pre-trained model like BERT or RoBERTa to classify the news articles. We can then measure the progress by calculating the accuracy of the model. We can simplify the problem by reducing the number of categories to two. We can also use a simpler model like a decision tree or a logistic regression model. The key assumptions underlying this problem are that the news articles are well categorized and that the categories are distinct.

Now, examine the following news text and identify whether it should be classified as World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech content. Your classification must be formatted with <final_answer> tags for automated extraction by our system.

News Text: ""The latest advancements in artificial intelligence have revolutionized the way we interact with technology. Companies are investing heavily in AI to develop new products and services.""
