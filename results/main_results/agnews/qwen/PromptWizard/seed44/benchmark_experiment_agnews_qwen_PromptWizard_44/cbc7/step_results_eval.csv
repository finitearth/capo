The dataset contains news articles categorized into four classes: World, Sports, Business, and Sci/Tech. The task is to classify each news article into one of the four categories. The class will be extracted between the markers <final_answer>answer</final_answer>.

Examine the following news text and classify it into one of the following categories: World, Sports, Business, or Sci/Tech. Each category is defined as follows:
- World: International affairs, politics, and global events.
- Sports: Athletic competitions and sports-related news.
- Business: Corporate news, financial markets, and economic trends.
- Sci/Tech: Scientific discoveries, technological advancements, and innovations.

Consider the context of the news text, including the source, language used, and overall theme. Your classification must be formatted with <final_answer> tags for automated extraction by our system.

Example classifications:
- World: ""EU leaders meet to discuss climate change policies.""
- Sports: ""LeBron James scores 40 points in Lakers' victory.""
