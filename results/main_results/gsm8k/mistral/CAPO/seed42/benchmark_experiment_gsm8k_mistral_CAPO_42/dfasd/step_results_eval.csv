Input:
Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, we will break it down into logical steps:

1. **Initial number of tabs:**
   Jose started with 400 tabs.

2. **Closing 1/4 of the tabs:**
   \[ \text{Tabs closed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]
   \[ \textRemaining tabs} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

3. **Closing 2/5 of the remaining tabs:**
   \[ \textTabs closed} = \frac{2}{5} \times 300 = 120 \]
   \[ \textRemaining tabs} = 300 - 120 = 180\]

4. **Closing half of the remaining tabs:**
   \[ \textTabs closed} = \frac{1}{2} \times 180 = 90 \]

During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of necklaces Boudrex caught.**
   - Boudreax caught 12 necklaces.

2. **Determine the number of necklaces Rhonda caught.**
   - Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudrx.
   - Therefore, Rhonda caught \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) necklaces.

Input:
Jane is sewing sequins onto her trapeze artist costume. She sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each, 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each, and 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. How many sequins does she add total?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of sequins Jane adds to her costume by summing the sequins in each row. We can break this down into three parts:

1. **Blue sequins**:
   - 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each.
   - Total blue sequins = 6 rows * 8 sequins per row = 48 blue sequins.

2. **Purple sequins**:
   - 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each.
   - Total purple sequins = 5 rows * 12 sequins per row = 60 purple sequins.

3. **Green sequins**:
   - 9 rows of 6 green sequins each.
   - Total green sequins = 9 rows * 6 sequins per row = 54 green sequins.

Now, we add the total number of sequins from each color:

Total sequins = 48 blue sequins + 60 purple sequins + 54 green sequins = 162 sequins.

In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. If Nora is currently 10 years old, how old is Terry now?
Output:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Determine Nora's age in 10 years:**
   - Nora is currently 10 years old.
   - In 10 years, Nora will be \(10 + 10 = 20\) years old.

2. **Determine Terry's age in 10 years:**
   - According to the problem, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently.
   - Since Nora is currently 10 years old, Terry will be \(4 \times 10 = 40$ years old in 10 years.

3. **Determine Terry's current age:**
   - If Terry will be 40 years old in 10 years, we need to subtract 10 years to find his current age.
   - Therefore, Terry's current age is $40 - 10 = 30$ years.

Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the given information to find the width of the sandbox. Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Define the variables:**
   - Let \( w \) be the width of the sandbox.
   - Let \( l \) be the length of the sandbox.

2. **Use the given information:**
   - The length is twice the width: \( l = 2w$.
   - The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet: \(2l + 2w = 30$.

3. **Substitute the length in terms of the width:**
   - Substitute \( l = 2w$ into the perimeter equation:
   \[ 2(2w) + 2w = 30 \]
   \[ 4w + 2w = 30 \]
   \[ 6w = 30 \]

4. **Solve for the width:**
   \[ w = \frac{30}{6} \]
    \[ w = 5 \]

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of necklaces Boudrex caught.**
   - Boudreax caught 12 necklaces.

2. **Determine the number of necklaces Rhonda caught.**
   - Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudrx.
   - Therefore, Rhonda caught \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) necklaces.

3. **Determine the number of necklaces Latch caught.**
   - Latch caught three times as many necklaces as Rhonda, minus four.
   - Therefore, Latch caught \( 3 \times 6 - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \) necklaces.

Input:
Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written and then determine how many more pages he needs to write to complete the 500-page book.

1. **First Day:**
   Cyrus writes 25 pages.

2. **Second Day:**
   Cyrus writes twice the amount he wrote on the first day.
   \[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pages} \]

3. **Third Day:**
   Cyrus writes twice the amount he wrote on the second day.
   \[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ pages} \]

4. **Fourth Day:**
   Cyrus writes 10 pages.

Now, let's sum the total number of pages written:
\[ 25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 \text{ pages} \]

To find out how many more pages Cyrus needs to write:
\[ 500 - 185 = 315 \text{ pages} \]

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of slices**:
   The pizza is cut into 8 slices.

2. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Angeli and Marlon**:

Input:
Jane is sewing sequins onto her trapeze artist costume. She sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each, 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each, and 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. How many sequins does she add total?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of sequins Jane adds to her costume by summing the sequins in each row. We can break this down into three parts:

1. **Blue sequins**:
   - 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each.
   - Total blue sequins = 6 rows * 8 sequins per row = 48 blue sequins.

2. **Purple sequins**:
   - 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each.
   - Total purple sequins = 5 rows * 12 sequins per row = 60 purple sequins.

3. **Green sequins**:
   - 9 rows of 6 green sequins each.
   - Total green sequins = 9 rows * 6 sequins per row = 54 green sequins.

Now, we add the total number of sequins from each color:

Total sequins = 48 blue sequins + 60 purple sequins + 54 green sequins = 162 sequins.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of slices**:
   The pizza is cut into 8 slices.

2. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Angeli and Marlon**:
   Each person ate 3/2 slices.
   Therefore, the total number of slices eaten by both is:
   \[ 3/2 + 3/2 = 3 \]

3. **Calculate the remaining number of slices**:
   Subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
   \[ 8 - 3 = 5 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is <final_answer>5</final_answer>.

Input:
Jane is sewing sequins onto her trapeze artist costume. She sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each, 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each, and 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. How many sequins does she add total?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of sequins Jane adds to her costume by summing the sequins in each row. We can break this down into three parts:

1. **Blue sequins**:
   - 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each.
   - Total blue sequins = 6 rows * 8 sequins per row = 48 blue sequins.

2. **Purple sequins**:
   - 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each.
   - Total purple sequins = 5 rows * 12 sequins per row = 60 purple sequins.

3. **Green sequins**:
   - 9 rows of 6 green sequins each.
   - Total green sequins = 9 rows * 6 sequins per row = 54 green sequins.

Now, we add the total number of sequins from each color:

Total sequins = 48 blue sequins + 60 purple sequins + 54 green sequins = 162 sequins.

Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written and then determine how many more pages he needs to write to complete the 500-page book.

1. **First Day:**
   Cyrus writes 25 pages.

2. **Second Day:**
   Cyrus writes twice the amount he wrote on the first day.
   \[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pages} \]

3. **Third Day:**
   Cyrus writes twice the amount he wrote on the second day.
   \[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ pages} \]

4. **Fourth Day:**
   Cyrus writes 10 pages.

Bert bought some unique stamps for his collection. Before the purchase, he had only half the stamps he bought. If he bought 300 stamps, how many stamps does Bert have in total after the purchase?
Output:
Let's solve this step-by step:

1. **Determine the number of stamps Bert had before the purchase:**
   Bert had half the number of stamps he bought. If he bought 300 stamps, then he had:
   \[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the total number of slices**:
   The pizza is cut into 8 slices.

2. **Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Angeli and Marlon**:
   Each person ate 3/2 slices.
   Therefore, the total number of slices eaten by both is:
   \[ 3/2 + 3/2 = 3 \]

3. **Calculate the remaining number of slices**:
   Subtract the total number of slices eaten from the total number of slices:
   \[ 8 - 3 = 5 \]

So, the number of slices of pizza left is <final_answer>5</final_answer>.

Bert bought some unique stamps for his collection. Before the purchase, he had only half the stamps he bought. If he bought 300 stamps, how many stamps does Bert have in total after the purchase?
Output:
Let's solve this step-by step:

1. **Determine the number of stamps Bert had before the purchase:**
   Bert had half the number of stamps he bought. If he bought 300 stamps, then he had:
   \[ \frac{300}{2} = 150 \]
   stamps before the purchase.

2. **Calculate the total number of stamps after the purchase:**

During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of necklaces Boudrex caught.**
   - Boudreax caught 12 necklaces.

2. **Determine the number of necklaces Rhonda caught.**
   - Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudrx.
   - Therefore, Rhonda caught \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) necklaces.

3. **Determine the number of necklaces Latch caught.**
   - Latch caught three times as many necklaces as Rhonda, minus four.
   - Therefore, Latch caught \( 3 \times 6 - 4 = 18 - 4 = 14 \) necklaces.

Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written and then determine how many more pages he needs to write to complete the 500-page book.

1. **First Day:**
   Cyrus writes 25 pages.

   \[ \text{Tabs closed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]
   \[ \textRemaining tabs} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

3. **Closing 2/5 of the remaining tabs:**
   \[ \textTabs closed} = \frac{2}{5} \times 300 = 120 \]
   \[ \textRemaining tabs} = 300 - 120 = 180\]

4. **Closing half of the remaining tabs:**
   \[ \textTabs closed} = \frac{1}{2} \times 180 = 90 \]

Input:
Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written and then determine how many more pages he needs to write to complete the 500-page book.

1. **First Day:**
   Cyrus writes 25 pages.

2. **Second Day:**
   Cyrus writes twice the amount he wrote on the first day.
   \[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pages} \]

3. **Third Day:**
   Cyrus writes twice the amount he wrote on the second day.
   \[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ pages} \]

4. **Fourth Day:**
   Cyrus writes 10 pages.

Now, let's sum the total number of pages written:
\[ 25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 \text{ pages} \]

To find out how many more pages Cyrus needs to write:
\[ 500 - 185 = 315 \text{ pages} \]

On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written and then determine how many more pages he needs to write to complete the 500-page book.

1. **First Day:**
   Cyrus writes 25 pages.

2. **Second Day:**
   Cyrus writes twice the amount he wrote on the first day.
   \[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pages} \]

3. **Third Day:**
   Cyrus writes twice the amount he wrote on the second day.
   \[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ pages} \]

4. **Fourth Day:**
   Cyrus writes 10 pages.

Now, let's sum the total number of pages written:
\[ 25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 \text{ pages} \]

To find out how many more pages Cyrus needs to write:
\[ 500 - 185 = 315 \text{ pages} \]

To solve this problem, we will break it down into logical steps:

1. **Initial number of tabs:**
   Jose started with 400 tabs.

2. **Closing 1/4 of the tabs:**
   \[ \text{Tabs closed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]
   \[ \textRemaining tabs} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

3. **Closing 2/5 of the remaining tabs:**
   \[ \textTabs closed} = \frac{2}{5} \times 300 = 120 \]

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written and then determine how many more pages he needs to write to complete the 500-page book.

1. **First Day:**
   Cyrus writes 25 pages.

2. **Second Day:**
   Cyrus writes twice the amount he wrote on the first day.
   \[ 2 \times 25 = 50 \text{ pages} \]

3. **Third Day:**
   Cyrus writes twice the amount he wrote on the second day.
   \[ 2 \times 50 = 100 \text{ pages} \]

4. **Fourth Day:**
   Cyrus writes 10 pages.

Now, let's sum the total number of pages written:
\[ 25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 \text{ pages} \]

To find out how many more pages Cyrus needs to write:
\[ 500 - 185 = 315 \text{ pages} \]

Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, we will break it down into logical steps:

1. **Initial number of tabs:**
   Jose started with 400 tabs.

2. **Closing 1/4 of the tabs:**
   \[ \text{Tabs closed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \]
   \[ \textRemaining tabs} = 400 - 100 = 300 \]

3. **Closing 2/5 of the remaining tabs:**
   \[ \textTabs closed} = \frac{2}{5} \times 300 = 120 \]
   \[ \textRemaining tabs} = 300 - 120 = 180\]

4. **Closing half of the remaining tabs:**
   \[ \textTabs closed} = \frac{1}{2} \times 180 = 90 \]
