     \[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]
   - From eight families contributing $10 each:
    \[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \]
   - From ten families contributing $5 each:
    \[ 10 \ x 5 = 50 \]

2. **Sum the total amount raised:**
    \[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount needed to reach the goal of $200:**

Input:
Ronald wants to make profits by re-selling some phones he bought a week ago. He bought 200 units for just $3000, and he wants to gain a third of the initial investment in profits when all units are sold. Including the profit margin, what will be the selling price for each phone?
Output:
To determine the selling price for each phone, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total profit Ronald wants to make:**
   Ronald wants to gain a third of the initial investment in profits. The initial investment is $3000.
   \[
    \text{Profit} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3000 = 1000
    \]

2. **Calculate the total cost including the profit:**
   The total cost is the initial investment plus the profit.
   \[
    \text{Total cost} = 3000 + 1000 = 4000
    \]

3. **Calculate the selling price per phone:
   Ronald has 200 units. To find the selling price per phone, divide the total cost by the number of units.
    \[
    \text{Selling price per phone} = \frac{4000}{200} = 20

Input:
Malik rushed for 18 yards in each of 4 games. Josiah ran for 22 yards in each of 4 games. Darnell had an average of 11 yards rushed for each of the 4 games. How many yards did the 3 athletes run in total?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total yards run by each athlete and then sum these totals to get the overall yards run by all three athletes.

1. **Calculate the total yards run by Malik:**
   - Malik ran 18 yards in each of 4 games.
   - Total yards for Malik = 18 yards/game * 4 games = 72 yards.

2. **Calculate the total yards run by Josiah:**
   - Josiah ran 22 yards in each of 4 games.
   - Total yards for Josiah = 22 yards/game * 4 games = 88 yards.

3. **Calculate the total yards run by Darnell:**
   - Darnell had an average of 11 yards in each of 4 games.
   - Total yards for Darnell = 11 yards/game * 4 games = 44 yards.

Input:
Ronald wants to make profits by re-selling some phones he bought a week ago. He bought 200 units for just $3000, and he wants to gain a third of the initial investment in profits when all units are sold. Including the profit margin, what will be the selling price for each phone?
Output:
To determine the selling price for each phone, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total profit Ronald wants to make:**
   Ronald wants to gain a third of the initial investment in profits. The initial investment is $3000.
   \[
    \text{Profit} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3000 = 1000
    \]

2. **Calculate the total cost including the profit:**
   The total cost is the initial investment plus the profit.
   \[
    \text{Total cost} = 3000 + 1000 = 4000
    \]

3. **Calculate the selling price per phone:
   Ronald has 200 units. To find the selling price per phone, divide the total cost by the number of units.
    \[
    \text{Selling price per phone} = \frac{4000}{200} = 20

Output:
Let's solve this step by step:

1. **Initial Problems Completed:**
   Georgia completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes.

2. **Problems Completed in the next 20 minutes:**
   In the next 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she did in the first 20 minutes. So, she completed \(2 \times 10 = 20\) problems.

3. **Total problems completed so far:**
   The total number of problems completed is \(10 + 20 = 30$ problems.

4. **Total problems remaining:**

1. **Calculate the total profit Ronald wants to make:**
   Ronald wants to gain a third of the initial investment in profits. The initial investment is $3000.
   \[
    \text{Profit} = \frac{1}{3} \times 3000 = 1000
    \]

2. **Calculate the total cost including the profit:**
   The total cost is the initial investment plus the profit.
   \[
    \text{Total cost} = 3000 + 1000 = 4000
    \]

3. **Calculate the selling price per phone:
   Ronald has 200 units. To find the selling price per phone, divide the total cost by the number of units.
    \[
    \text{Selling price per phone} = \frac{4000}{200} = 20
    \]

Camille saw 3 cardinals and four times as many robins as cardinals while bird watching. She also saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals and 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals. How many birds did Camille see?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of each type of bird Camille saw and then sum them up. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cardinals**: Camilile saw 3 cardinal birds.
2. **Robins**: She saw four times as many robins as cardinal birds.
   \[ \text{Robins} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \]
3. **Blue Jays**: She saw twice as many blue jays as cardinal birds.
   \[ \text{Blue Jays} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
4. **Sparrows**: She saw 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinal birds.
   \[ \text{Sparrows} = 3 \times 3 + 1 = 10 \]

Now, we sum up all the birds:
\[ \text{Total birds} = 3 + 12 + 6 + 10 = 31 \]

   - From eight families contributing $10 each:
    \[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \]
   - From ten families contributing $5 each:
    \[ 10 \ x 5 = 50 \]

2. **Sum the total amount raised:**
    \[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \]

3. **Calculate the remaining amount needed to reach the goal of $200:**

To determine the selling price for each phone, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total profit Ronald wants to make:**
   Ronald wants to gain a third of the initial investment in profits. The initial investment is $3000.

   Georgia completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes.

2. **Problems Completed in the next 20 minutes:**
   In the next 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she did in the first 20 minutes. So, she completed \(2 \times 10 = 20\) problems.

3. **Total problems completed so far:**
   The total number of problems completed is \(10 + 20 = 30$ problems.

4. **Total problems remaining:**
   The total number of problems on the test is 75. So, the number of problems remaining is $75 - 30 = 45$ problems.

Input:
Camille saw 3 cardinals and four times as many robins as cardinals while bird watching. She also saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals and 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals. How many birds did Camille see?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of each type of bird Camille saw and then sum them up. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Cardinals**: Camilile saw 3 cardinal birds.
2. **Robins**: She saw four times as many robins as cardinal birds.
   \[ \text{Robins} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \]
3. **Blue Jays**: She saw twice as many blue jays as cardinal birds.
   \[ \text{Blue Jays} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]
4. **Sparrows**: She saw 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinal birds.
   \[ \text{Sparrows} = 3 \times 3 + 1 = 10 \]

Now, we sum up all the birds:
\[ \text{Total birds} = 3 + 12 + 6 + 10 = 31 \]

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randyâ€™s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of biscuits Randy received:**
   - Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
   - His father gave him 13 biscuits.
   - His mother gave him 15 biscuits.

   Total biscuits = 32 + 13 + 15 = 60 biscuits.

2. **Calculate the number of biscuits Randy's brother ate:**
   - Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits.

3. **Calculate the remaining number of biscuits:**
   - Subtract the number of biscuits eaten by Randy's brother from the total number of biscuits.

   Remaining biscuits = 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.
