Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of paper cranes Alice folds herself:**
   Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes.
   \[ \text{Paper cranes Alice folds} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]

2. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after Alice folds her portion:**
   \[ \textRemaining paper cranes} = 1000 - 500 = 500 \]

3. **Calculate the number of paper cranes the friend folds:**
   The friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes.
   \[ \textPaper cranes friend folds} = \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]

4. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after the friend folds her portion:**
   \[ \textRemaining paper cranes} = 500 - 100 = 400\]

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranines.

Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of each type of insect and then sum them up.

1. **Giant Roaches**: Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. **Scorpions**: Calvin has 3 scorpions.
3. **Crickets**: Calvin has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) crickets.
4. **Caterpillars**: Calvin has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) caterpillars.

Now, we sum up all the insects:

Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output:
To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the variables**:
   Let \( c$ be the number of cucumbers.
   Let $t$ be the number of tomatoes.

2. **Set up the equations based on the problem:
   - The total number of vegetables is 280.
   - There are three times as many tomatoes as cucumbers.

   Therefore, we have:
   \[ c + t = 280 \]
   \[ t = 3c \]

3. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
   \[ c + 3c = 280 \]
   \[ 4c = 280\]

4. **Solve for $c$:
   \[ c = \frac{280}{4} \]
    \[ c = 70\]

So, the number of cucumbers used in the salad is <final_answer>70</final_answer>.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of paper cranes Alice folds herself:**
   Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes.
   \[ \text{Paper cranes Alice folds} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]

Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of paper cranes Alice folds herself:**
   Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes.
   \[ \text{Paper cranes Alice folds} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]

2. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after Alice folds her portion:**
   \[ \textRemaining paper cranes} = 1000 - 500 = 500 \]

3. **Calculate the number of paper cranes the friend folds:**
   The friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes.
   \[ \textPaper cranes friend folds} = \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]

4. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after the friend folds her portion:**

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of paper cranes Alice folds herself:**
   Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes.
   \[ \text{Paper cranes Alice folds} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]

2. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after Alice folds her portion:**
   \[ \textRemaining paper cranes} = 1000 - 500 = 500 \]

3. **Calculate the number of paper cranes the friend folds:**
   The friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes.
   \[ \textPaper cranes friend folds} = \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]

4. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after the friend folds her portion:**

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break down Claire's activities and calculate the time spent on each activity.

1. **Cleaning**: Claire spends 4 hours cleaning.
2. **Cooking**: Claire spends 2 hours cooking.
3. **Sleeping**: Claire spends 8 hours sleeping.

Now, let's calculate the remaining time for crafting and tailoring.

The total time in a day is 24 hours.

So, the remaining time for crafting and tailoring is:
\[ 24 - 4 - 2 - 8 = 10 \]

Since Claire divides the remaining time equally between crafting and tailoring, the time spent on crafting is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of paper cranes Alice folds herself:**
   Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes.
   \[ \text{Paper cranes Alice folds} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]

2. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after Alice folds her portion:**
   \[ \textRemaining paper cranes} = 1000 - 500 = 500 \]

3. **Calculate the number of paper cranes the friend folds:**
   The friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes.
   \[ \textPaper cranes friend folds} = \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]

4. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after the friend folds her portion:**
   \[ \textRemaining paper cranes} = 500 - 100 = 400\]

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranines.

To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of cutting the pizza and distributing the slices to Phil's friends. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cut**: Phil cuts the pizza in half.
   - Number of slices: 2

2. **Second Cut: Phil cuts both halves in half.
   - Number of slices: 2 + 2 = 4

3. **Third cut: Phil cuts each slice in half.
   - Number of slices: 4 + 4 = 8

4. **Distribution: Phil passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.
   - Number of slices given to 3 friends: 3 * 1 = 3
   - Number of slices given to 2 friends: 2 * 2 = 4
   - Total slices given: 3 + 4 = 7

5. **Remaining slices: Subtract the distributed slices from the total number of slices.
   - Remaining slices: 8 - 7 = 1

Input:
Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate half of the number of toys Bill has.**
2. ** Determine how many more toys Hash has than half of Bill's toys.
3. ** Calculate the total number of toys Hash has.
4. ** Add the total number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total number of toys.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Calculate half of the number of toys Bill has:**
   \[ \text{Half of Bill's toys} = \frac{60}{2} = 30 \]

2. ** Determine how many more toys Hash has than half of Bill's toys:**
   \[ \textMore toys Hash has = 30 + 9 = 39 \]

3. ** Calculate the total number of toys Hash has:**
   \[ \textTotal toys Hash has = 39 \]

4. ** Add the total number of toys Hash has to the number of toys Bill has to find the total number of toys:
   \[ \textTotal toys = 60 + 39 = 99 \]

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break down Claire's activities and calculate the time spent on each activity.

1. **Cleaning**: Claire spends 4 hours cleaning.
2. **Cooking**: Claire spends 2 hours cooking.
3. **Sleeping**: Claire spends 8 hours sleeping.

Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of paper cranes Alice folds herself:**
   Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes.
   \[ \text{Paper cranes Alice folds} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]

2. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after Alice folds her portion:**
   \[ \textRemaining paper cranes} = 1000 - 500 = 500 \]

3. **Calculate the number of paper cranes the friend folds:**
   The friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes.
   \[ \textPaper cranes friend folds} = \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]

4. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after the friend folds her portion:**

Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of each type of insect and then sum them up.

1. **Giant Roaches**: Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. **Scorpions**: Calvin has 3 scorpions.
3. **Crickets**: Calvin has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) crickets.
4. **Caterpillars**: Calvin has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) caterpillars.

Now, we sum up all the insects:
\[ 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27 \]

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps of cutting the pizza and distributing the slices to Phil's friends. Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Initial Cut**: Phil cuts the pizza in half.
   - Number of slices: 2

2. **Second Cut: Phil cuts both halves in half.
   - Number of slices: 2 + 2 = 4

3. **Third cut: Phil cuts each slice in half.
   - Number of slices: 4 + 4 = 8

4. **Distribution: Phil passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.
   - Number of slices given to 3 friends: 3 * 1 = 3
   - Number of slices given to 2 friends: 2 * 2 = 4
   - Total slices given: 3 + 4 = 7

5. **Remaining slices: Subtract the distributed slices from the total number of slices.
   - Remaining slices: 8 - 7 = 1

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of paper cranes Alice folds herself:**
   Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes.
   \[ \text{Paper cranes Alice folds} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]

2. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after Alice folds her portion:**
   \[ \textRemaining paper cranes} = 1000 - 500 = 500 \]

3. **Calculate the number of paper cranes the friend folds:**
   The friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes.
   \[ \textPaper cranes friend folds} = \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]

4. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after the friend folds her portion:**
   \[ \textRemaining paper cranes} = 500 - 100 = 400\]

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranines.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break down Claire's activities and calculate the time spent on each activity.

1. **Cleaning**: Claire spends 4 hours cleaning.
2. **Cooking**: Claire spends 2 hours cooking.
3. **Sleeping**: Claire spends 8 hours sleeping.

Now, let's calculate the remaining time for crafting and tailoring.

The total time in a day is 24 hours.

So, the remaining time for crafting and tailoring is:
\[ 24 - 4 - 2 - 8 = 10 \]

Since Claire divides the remaining time equally between crafting and tailoring, the time spent on crafting is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps:

1. **Calculate the number of paper cranes Alice folds herself:**
   Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes.
   \[ \text{Paper cranes Alice folds} = \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]

2. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after Alice folds her portion:**
   \[ \textRemaining paper cranes} = 1000 - 500 = 500 \]

3. **Calculate the number of paper cranes the friend folds:**
   The friend folds a fifth of the remaining 500 paper cranes.
   \[ \textPaper cranes friend folds} = \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]

4. **Calculate the remaining paper cranes after the friend folds her portion:**
   \[ \textRemaining paper cranes} = 500 - 100 = 400\]

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranines.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break down Claire's activities and calculate the time spent on each activity.

1. **Cleaning**: Claire spends 4 hours cleaning.
2. **Cooking**: Claire spends 2 hours cooking.
3. **Sleeping**: Claire spends 8 hours sleeping.

Now, let's calculate the remaining time for crafting and tailoring.

The total time in a day is 24 hours.

So, the remaining time for crafting and tailoring is:
\[ 24 - 4 - 2 - 8 = 10 \]

Since Claire divides the remaining time equally between crafting and tailoring, the time spent on crafting is:
\[ \frac{10}{2} = 5 \]

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.
