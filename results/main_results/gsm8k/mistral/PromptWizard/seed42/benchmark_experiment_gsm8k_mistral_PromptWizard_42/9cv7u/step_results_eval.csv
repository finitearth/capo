Calling all math wizards! I need help with this tricky multi-step word problem. Let's devise an experiment to solve this problem. We'll start by breaking down the problem into smaller steps and then solve each step one by one. We'll measure progress by checking if each step is solved correctly. We'll simplify the problem by breaking it down into smaller parts and solving each part individually. The key assumptions underlying this problem are that each step can be solved independently and that the solution to each step can be combined to solve the entire problem. Now, walk me through your solution process and wrap the final answer with <final_answer> </final_answer> tags.



[Question] If Sarah bought 15 apples and Diana bought 20 more apples than Sarah, and each apple costs $1.5, how much did they spend on apples?
[Answer] To solve the problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps and solve each step one by one. Here is the reasoning chain:

1. **Determine the number of apples Diana bought:**
   - Sarah bought 15 apples.
   - Diana bought 20 more apples than Sarah.
   - Therefore, Diana bought 15 + 20 = 35 apples.

2. **Calculate the total number of apples bought by Sarah and Diana:**
   - Sarah bought 15 apples.
    - Diana bought 35 apples.
    - Therefore, the total number of apples bought is 15 + 35 = 45 apples.

3. **Calculate the total cost of the apples:
    - Each apple costs $1.5.
    - The total number of apples is 45.
    - Therefore, the total cost is 45 * $1.5 = $67.5.

[Question] If John bought 20 apples and each apple costs $2, how much did he spend on apples?
[Answer] To solve the problem, we need to break it down into smaller steps and solve each step one by one. Here is the reasoning chain:

1. **Identify the cost of each apple**:
   - Each apple costs $2.

2. **Calculate the total cost of the apples:
   - John bought 20 apples.
   - The total cost is calculated by multiplying the number of apples by the cost of each apple.
   - Total cost = 20 apples * $2 per apple = $40.

3. **Final answer:
   - The total amount John spent on apples is $40.
