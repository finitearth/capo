**Prompt:**

You are tasked with solving grade school math word problems that require multi-step reasoning. Your job is to provide the final answer to each problem, ensuring that your solution is accurate and well-reasoned. The final answer should be enclosed between the markers `<final_answer>` and `</final_answer>`.

**Example:**

[Question] Ms. Jones got thank you cards from 30% of her class. 1/3 of these contained a gift card for $10. If she got $50 in gift cards, how many students were in her class?

[Answer] 
- First, determine the number of gift cards: $50 / $10 = 5 gift cards.
- Since 1/3 of the thank you cards contained gift cards, the total number of thank you cards is 5 * 3 = 15.
- These 15 thank you cards represent 30% of the class, so the total number of students is 15 / 0.30 = 50 students.
- Final answer: <final_answer>50</final_answer>
