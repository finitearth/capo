Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Cutting of the Pizza:**
   - Phill starts with a whole pizza.
   - He cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 slices.
   - He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 slices.
   - He cuts each of these slices in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

2. **Distribution of Slices:**
   - Phill gives 1 slice to each of 3 friends, which totals 3 slices.
   - He gives 2 slices to each of 2 friends, which totals 4 slices.

3. **Total Slices Given Away:**
   - Total slices given to friends = 3 slices (to 3 friends) + 4 slices (to 2 friends) = 7 slices.

4. **Slices Left for Phill:**
   - Total slices initially = 8 slices.
   - Slices given away = 7 slices.
   - Slices left for Phill = 8 slices - 7 slices = 1 slice.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left for Phill is <final_answer>1</final_answer>.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours Claire spends on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping. The remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring.

A day has 24 hours.

Claire spends:
- 4 hours cleaning
- 2 hours cooking
- 8 hours sleeping

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping:
<latex>4 + 2 + 8 = 14</latex>

Subtracting these from the total hours in a day gives us the remaining hours for crafting and tailoring:
<latex>24 - 14 = 10</latex>

Since the remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
<latex>\frac{10}{2} = 5</latex>

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

A hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many balloons remain intact.

1. **Initial Condition**: The hot air balloon starts with 200 balloons.

2. **After Half an Hour**: 1/5 of the total number of balloons have blown up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after half an hour = 1/5 * 200 = 40 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after half an hour = 200 - 40 = 160 balloons.

3. **After Another Hour**: Twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after another hour = 2 * 40 = 80 balloons.
   - Total number of balloons blown up after another hour = 40 (from the first half-hour) + 80 (from the next hour) = 120 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after another hour = 200 - 120 = 80 balloons.

Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is <final_answer>80</final_answer>.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps Phill takes to cut the pizza and then distribute the slices among his friends.

Step 1: Determine the number of slices after each cut.
- Phill starts with a whole pizza.
- He cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 slices.
- He cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 slices.
- He cuts each of those slices in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

So, after all the cuts, Phill has 8 slices of pizza.

Step 2: Determine how many slices Phill's friends receive.
- Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which totals 3 slices.
- He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which totals 4 slices.

So, Phill's friends receive a total of 3 + 4 = 7 slices.

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices left for Phill.
- Phill started with 8 slices.
- His friends received 7 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices left for Phill is 8 - 7 = 1 slice.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours Claire spends on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping. The remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring.

A day has 24 hours.

Claire spends:
- 4 hours cleaning
- 2 hours cooking
- 8 hours sleeping

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping:
<latex>4 + 2 + 8 = 14</latex>

Subtracting these from the total hours in a day gives us the remaining hours for crafting and tailoring:
<latex>24 - 14 = 10</latex>

Since the remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
<latex>\frac{10}{2} = 5</latex>

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

A hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many balloons remain intact.

1. **Initial Condition**: The hot air balloon starts with 200 balloons.

2. **After Half an Hour**: 1/5 of the total number of balloons have blown up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after half an hour = 1/5 * 200 = 40 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after half an hour = 200 - 40 = 160 balloons.

3. **After Another Hour**: Twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after another hour = 2 * 40 = 80 balloons.
   - Total number of balloons blown up after another hour = 40 (from the first half-hour) + 80 (from the next hour) = 120 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after another hour = 200 - 120 = 80 balloons.

Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is <final_answer>80</final_answer>.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the steps Phill takes to cut the pizza and then distribute the slices among his friends.

Step 1: Determine the number of slices after each cut.
- Phill starts with a whole pizza.
- He cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 slices.
- He cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 slices.
- He cuts each of those slices in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

So, after all the cuts, Phill has 8 slices of pizza.

Step 2: Determine how many slices Phill's friends receive.
- Phill passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which totals 3 slices.
- He also passes out 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which totals 4 slices.

So, Phill's friends receive a total of 3 + 4 = 7 slices.

Step 3: Calculate the number of slices left for Phill.
- Phill started with 8 slices.
- His friends received 7 slices.

Therefore, the number of slices left for Phill is 8 - 7 = 1 slice.

Input:
A hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many balloons remain intact.

1. **Initial Condition**: The hot air balloon starts with 200 balloons.

2. **After Half an Hour**: 1/5 of the total number of balloons have blown up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after half an hour = 1/5 * 200 = 40 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after half an hour = 200 - 40 = 160 balloons.

3. **After Another Hour**: Twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after another hour = 2 * 40 = 80 balloons.
   - Total number of balloons blown up after another hour = 40 (from the first half-hour) + 80 (from the next hour) = 120 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after another hour = 200 - 120 = 80 balloons.

Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is <final_answer>80</final_answer>.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many toys Hash has based on the information given.
2. Calculate the total number of toys both Hash and Bill have together.

Step 1: Determine how many toys Hash has.
- We are told that Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Cutting of the Pizza:**
   - Phill starts with a whole pizza.
   - He cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 slices.
   - He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 slices.
   - He cuts each of these slices in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

2. **Distribution of Slices:**
   - Phill gives 1 slice to each of 3 friends, which totals 3 slices.
   - He gives 2 slices to each of 2 friends, which totals 4 slices.

3. **Total Slices Given Away:**
   - Total slices given to friends = 3 slices (to 3 friends) + 4 slices (to 2 friends) = 7 slices.

4. **Slices Left for Phill:**
   - Total slices initially = 8 slices.
   - Slices given away = 7 slices.
   - Slices left for Phill = 8 slices - 7 slices = 1 slice.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left for Phill is <final_answer>1</final_answer>.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours Claire spends on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping. The remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring.

A day has 24 hours.

Claire spends:
- 4 hours cleaning
- 2 hours cooking
- 8 hours sleeping

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping:
<latex>4 + 2 + 8 = 14</latex>

Subtracting these from the total hours in a day gives us the remaining hours for crafting and tailoring:
<latex>24 - 14 = 10</latex>

Since the remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
<latex>\frac{10}{2} = 5</latex>

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many balloons remain intact.

1. **Initial Condition**: The hot air balloon starts with 200 balloons.

2. **After Half an Hour**: 1/5 of the total number of balloons have blown up.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Cutting of the Pizza:**
   - Phill starts with a whole pizza.
   - He cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 slices.
   - He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 slices.
   - He cuts each of these slices in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

2. **Distribution of Slices:**
   - Phill gives 1 slice to each of 3 friends, which totals 3 slices.
   - He gives 2 slices to each of 2 friends, which totals 4 slices.

3. **Total Slices Given Away:**
   - Total slices given to friends = 3 slices (to 3 friends) + 4 slices (to 2 friends) = 7 slices.

4. **Slices Left for Phill:**
   - Total slices initially = 8 slices.
   - Slices given away = 7 slices.
   - Slices left for Phill = 8 slices - 7 slices = 1 slice.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left for Phill is <final_answer>1</final_answer>.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours Claire spends on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping. The remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring.

A day has 24 hours.

Claire spends:
- 4 hours cleaning
- 2 hours cooking
- 8 hours sleeping

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping:
<latex>4 + 2 + 8 = 14</latex>

Subtracting these from the total hours in a day gives us the remaining hours for crafting and tailoring:
<latex>24 - 14 = 10</latex>

Since the remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
<latex>\frac{10}{2} = 5</latex>

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

A hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many balloons remain intact.

1. **Initial Condition**: The hot air balloon starts with 200 balloons.

2. **After Half an Hour**: 1/5 of the total number of balloons have blown up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after half an hour = 1/5 * 200 = 40 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after half an hour = 200 - 40 = 160 balloons.

3. **After Another Hour**: Twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after another hour = 2 * 40 = 80 balloons.
   - Total number of balloons blown up after another hour = 40 (from the first half-hour) + 80 (from the next hour) = 120 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after another hour = 200 - 120 = 80 balloons.

Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is <final_answer>80</final_answer>.

Input:
A hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many balloons remain intact.

1. **Initial Condition**: The hot air balloon starts with 200 balloons.

2. **After Half an Hour**: 1/5 of the total number of balloons have blown up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after half an hour = 1/5 * 200 = 40 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after half an hour = 200 - 40 = 160 balloons.

3. **After Another Hour**: Twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after another hour = 2 * 40 = 80 balloons.
   - Total number of balloons blown up after another hour = 40 (from the first half-hour) + 80 (from the next hour) = 120 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after another hour = 200 - 120 = 80 balloons.

Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is <final_answer>80</final_answer>.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours Claire spends on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping. The remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring.

A day has 24 hours.

Claire spends:
- 4 hours cleaning
- 2 hours cooking
- 8 hours sleeping

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping:
<latex>4 + 2 + 8 = 14</latex>

Subtracting these from the total hours in a day gives us the remaining hours for crafting and tailoring:
<latex>24 - 14 = 10</latex>

Since the remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
<latex>\frac{10}{2} = 5</latex>

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many balloons remain intact.

1. **Initial Condition**: The hot air balloon starts with 200 balloons.

2. **After Half an Hour**: 1/5 of the total number of balloons have blown up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after half an hour = 1/5 * 200 = 40 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after half an hour = 200 - 40 = 160 balloons.

3. **After Another Hour**: Twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after another hour = 2 * 40 = 80 balloons.
   - Total number of balloons blown up after another hour = 40 (from the first half-hour) + 80 (from the next hour) = 120 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after another hour = 200 - 120 = 80 balloons.

Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is <final_answer>80</final_answer>.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours Claire spends on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping. The remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring.

A day has 24 hours.

Claire spends:
- 4 hours cleaning
- 2 hours cooking
- 8 hours sleeping

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping:
<latex>4 + 2 + 8 = 14</latex>

Subtracting these from the total hours in a day gives us the remaining hours for crafting and tailoring:
<latex>24 - 14 = 10</latex>

Since the remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
<latex>\frac{10}{2} = 5</latex>

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

A hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many balloons remain intact.

1. **Initial Condition**: The hot air balloon starts with 200 balloons.

2. **After Half an Hour**: 1/5 of the total number of balloons have blown up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after half an hour = 1/5 * 200 = 40 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after half an hour = 200 - 40 = 160 balloons.

3. **After Another Hour**: Twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after another hour = 2 * 40 = 80 balloons.
   - Total number of balloons blown up after another hour = 40 (from the first half-hour) + 80 (from the next hour) = 120 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after another hour = 200 - 120 = 80 balloons.

Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is <final_answer>80</final_answer>.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours Claire spends on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping. The remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring.

A day has 24 hours.

Claire spends:
- 4 hours cleaning
- 2 hours cooking
- 8 hours sleeping

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping:
<latex>4 + 2 + 8 = 14</latex>

Subtracting these from the total hours in a day gives us the remaining hours for crafting and tailoring:
<latex>24 - 14 = 10</latex>

Since the remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
<latex>\frac{10}{2} = 5</latex>

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Initial Cutting of the Pizza:**
   - Phill starts with a whole pizza.
   - He cuts the pizza in half, resulting in 2 slices.
   - He then cuts both halves in half, resulting in 4 slices.
   - He cuts each of these slices in half again, resulting in 8 slices.

2. **Distribution of Slices:**
   - Phill gives 1 slice to each of 3 friends, which totals 3 slices.
   - He gives 2 slices to each of 2 friends, which totals 4 slices.

3. **Total Slices Given Away:**
   - Total slices given to friends = 3 slices (to 3 friends) + 4 slices (to 2 friends) = 7 slices.

4. **Slices Left for Phill:**
   - Total slices initially = 8 slices.
   - Slices given away = 7 slices.
   - Slices left for Phill = 8 slices - 7 slices = 1 slice.

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left for Phill is <final_answer>1</final_answer>.

A hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many balloons remain intact.

1. **Initial Condition**: The hot air balloon starts with 200 balloons.

2. **After Half an Hour**: 1/5 of the total number of balloons have blown up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after half an hour = 1/5 * 200 = 40 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after half an hour = 200 - 40 = 160 balloons.

3. **After Another Hour**: Twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after another hour = 2 * 40 = 80 balloons.
   - Total number of balloons blown up after another hour = 40 (from the first half-hour) + 80 (from the next hour) = 120 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after another hour = 200 - 120 = 80 balloons.

Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is <final_answer>80</final_answer>.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours Claire spends on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping. The remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring.

A day has 24 hours.

Claire spends:
- 4 hours cleaning
- 2 hours cooking
- 8 hours sleeping

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping:
<latex>4 + 2 + 8 = 14</latex>

Subtracting these from the total hours in a day gives us the remaining hours for crafting and tailoring:
<latex>24 - 14 = 10</latex>

Since the remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
<latex>\frac{10}{2} = 5</latex>

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

Input:
A hot air balloon with 200 balloons is blowing up. After about half an hour, 1/5 of the total number of balloons in the hot air balloon have blown up. After another hour, twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up. How many balloons in the hot air balloon remain intact?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step to find out how many balloons remain intact.

1. **Initial Condition**: The hot air balloon starts with 200 balloons.

2. **After Half an Hour**: 1/5 of the total number of balloons have blown up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after half an hour = 1/5 * 200 = 40 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after half an hour = 200 - 40 = 160 balloons.

3. **After Another Hour**: Twice the number of balloons that had already blown up also blow up.
   - Number of balloons blown up after another hour = 2 * 40 = 80 balloons.
   - Total number of balloons blown up after another hour = 40 (from the first half-hour) + 80 (from the next hour) = 120 balloons.
   - Number of balloons remaining after another hour = 200 - 120 = 80 balloons.

Therefore, the number of balloons that remain intact is <final_answer>80</final_answer>.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many toys Hash has based on the information given.
2. Calculate the total number of toys both Hash and Bill have together.

Step 1: Determine how many toys Hash has.
- We know that Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has.
- Bill has 60 toys.
- Half of Bill's toys is 60 / 2 = 30 toys.
- Therefore, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Step 2: Calculate the total number of toys both Hash and Bill have together.
- Bill has 60 toys.
- Hash has 39 toys.
- The total number of toys is 60 + 39 = 99 toys.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours Claire spends on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping. The remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring.

A day has 24 hours.

Claire spends:
- 4 hours cleaning
- 2 hours cooking
- 8 hours sleeping

Total hours spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping:
<latex>4 + 2 + 8 = 14</latex>

Subtracting these from the total hours in a day gives us the remaining hours for crafting and tailoring:
<latex>24 - 14 = 10</latex>

Since the remaining hours are divided equally between crafting and tailoring, we divide the remaining hours by 2:
<latex>\frac{10}{2} = 5</latex>

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.
