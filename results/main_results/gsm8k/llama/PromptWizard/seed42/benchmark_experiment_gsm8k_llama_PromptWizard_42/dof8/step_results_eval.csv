[Question] Tom has 18 boxes of pencils to pack into bags for a school supply drive. Each bag can hold 3 boxes of pencils. How many bags can Tom fill with the pencils he has?
[Answer] To solve this problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach to determine how many bags Tom can fill with the pencils he has.

1. **Identify the total number of boxes of pencils Tom has**: Tom has 18 boxes of pencils.

2. **Determine the capacity of each bag**: Each bag can hold 3 boxes of pencils.

3. **Divide the total number of boxes by the capacity of each bag**: To find out how many bags Tom can fill, we need to divide the total number of boxes of pencils (18) by the number of boxes each bag can hold (3). This operation will give us the total number of bags that can be completely filled.

4. **Perform the division**: 18 / 3 = 6.

5. **Interpret the result**: The result of the division, 6, represents the number of bags that Tom can fill with the pencils he has, given that each bag can hold 3 boxes of pencils.

6. **Conclusion**: Based on the calculation, Tom can fill a specific number of bags with the pencils he has. This number is the result of dividing the total number of boxes of pencils by the capacity of each bag.

Therefore, following the logical pathway and performing the necessary calculations <ANS_START>To find out how many bags Tom can fill, we need to divide the total number of boxes of pencils by the number of boxes each bag can hold. So, we divide 18 by 3. 18 / 3 = 6. Therefore, Tom can fill <ANS_START>6<ANS_END> bags with the pencils he has.<ANS_END>
