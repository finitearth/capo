[Question] A bookstore has 15 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 boxes of books. If the store is currently empty, and they receive a shipment of 120 boxes of books, how many shelves will be filled, and how many boxes will be left over?
[Answer] To solve this problem, we will follow a step-by-step approach to determine how many shelves will be filled and how many boxes will be left over after the bookstore receives a shipment of 120 boxes of books.

1. **Calculate the total capacity of the bookstore**: First, we need to find out how many boxes the bookstore can hold in total. This can be done by multiplying the number of shelves by the number of boxes each shelf can hold. The formula for this calculation is: Total Capacity = Number of Shelves * Number of Boxes per Shelf. Given that there are 15 shelves and each shelf can hold 8 boxes, the calculation is 15 * 8 = 120 boxes.

2. **Determine the number of shelves that will be filled**: Since the total capacity of the bookstore is 120 boxes and the store receives a shipment of 120 boxes, we need to determine how these boxes will fill the shelves. To find out how many shelves will be filled, we divide the total number of boxes received by the number of boxes each shelf can hold. The formula for this is: Number of Shelves Filled = Total Boxes Received / Boxes per Shelf. Substituting the given values, we get 120 / 8 = 15. This <ANS_START>To find the total number of boxes that can be held on all shelves, we multiply the number of shelves by the number of boxes each shelf can hold: 15 shelves * 8 boxes/shelf = 120 boxes. Since the store receives 120 boxes, all shelves will be filled. However, we need to calculate how many boxes will be left over after filling the shelves. Since 120 boxes can fill 15 shelves, and each shelf can hold 8 boxes, we can divide 120 by 8 to get 15. This means all shelves will be filled, and there will be no boxes left over. <ANS_START>0<ANS_END><ANS_END>
