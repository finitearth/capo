Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events step by step:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift, so we add these to the initial amount: 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. Then, his mother gave him 15 biscuits, so we add these to the total: 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Finally, Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so we subtract these from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

To find out how many lives a mouse has, we need to first determine the number of lives a dog has, since the number of lives a mouse has is based on the number of lives a dog has.

1. A cat has 9 lives.
2. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, the number of lives a dog has is 9 - 3 = 6.
3. A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, the number of lives a mouse has is 6 + 7 = 13.

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes.
2. In the next 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she did in the first 20 minutes. Since she completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes, in the second 20 minutes, she completed 2 * 10 = 20 problems.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Julie runs the school newspaper. In preparation for printing the next issue of The School News, she bought two boxes of standard paper, each containing 5 packages, with 250 sheets of paper per package.  If this issue of The School News uses 25 sheets of paper to print one newspaper, how many newspapers can Julie print with the paper that she purchased?
Output:
To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, we first need to calculate the total number of sheets of paper she has. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of packages in the two boxes:
Since each box contains 5 packages, two boxes will contain 2 * 5 = 10 packages.

2. Calculate the total number of sheets of paper:
Each package contains 250 sheets of paper. Since Julie has 10 packages, the total number of sheets is 10 * 250 = 2500 sheets.

3. Calculate how many newspapers Julie can print:
Each newspaper requires 25 sheets of paper. To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets per newspaper:
2500 / 25 = 100

So, Julie can print 100 newspapers with the paper she purchased.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
Julie runs the school newspaper. In preparation for printing the next issue of The School News, she bought two boxes of standard paper, each containing 5 packages, with 250 sheets of paper per package.  If this issue of The School News uses 25 sheets of paper to print one newspaper, how many newspapers can Julie print with the paper that she purchased?
Output:
To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, we first need to calculate the total number of sheets of paper she has. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of packages in the two boxes:
Since each box contains 5 packages, two boxes will contain 2 * 5 = 10 packages.

2. Calculate the total number of sheets of paper:
Each package contains 250 sheets of paper. Since Julie has 10 packages, the total number of sheets is 10 * 250 = 2500 sheets.

3. Calculate how many newspapers Julie can print:
Each newspaper requires 25 sheets of paper. To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets per newspaper:
2500 / 25 = 100

So, Julie can print 100 newspapers with the paper she purchased.

Input:
Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To find out how many problems Georgia has left to solve, we need to first determine how many problems she has already completed.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes.
2. In the next 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she did in the first 20 minutes. Since she completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes, in the second 20 minutes, she completed 2 * 10 = 20 problems.
3. The total number of problems Georgia has completed so far is 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.
4. The test has 75 problems in total. To find out how many problems Georgia has left to solve, we subtract the number of problems she has already completed from the total number of problems: 75 - 30 = 45 problems.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Output:
To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, we first need to calculate the total number of sheets of paper she has. Here's the step-by-step process:

3. Calculate how many newspapers Julie can print:
Each newspaper requires 25 sheets of paper. To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets per newspaper:
2500 / 25 = 100

So, Julie can print 100 newspapers with the paper she purchased.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randy’s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events step by step:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift, so we add these to the initial amount: 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. Then, his mother gave him 15 biscuits, so we add these to the total: 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Finally, Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so we subtract these from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Output:
To find out how many lives a mouse has, we need to first determine the number of lives a dog has, since the number of lives a mouse has is based on the number of lives a dog has.

1. A cat has 9 lives.
2. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, the number of lives a dog has is 9 - 3 = 6.
3. A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, the number of lives a mouse has is 6 + 7 = 13.

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To find out how many problems Georgia has left to solve, we need to first determine how many problems she has already completed.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes.
2. In the next 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she did in the first 20 minutes. Since she completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes, in the second 20 minutes, she completed 2 * 10 = 20 problems.
3. The total number of problems Georgia has completed so far is 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.
4. The test has 75 problems in total. To find out how many problems Georgia has left to solve, we subtract the number of problems she has already completed from the total number of problems: 75 - 30 = 45 problems.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Julie runs the school newspaper. In preparation for printing the next issue of The School News, she bought two boxes of standard paper, each containing 5 packages, with 250 sheets of paper per package.  If this issue of The School News uses 25 sheets of paper to print one newspaper, how many newspapers can Julie print with the paper that she purchased?
Output:
To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, we first need to calculate the total number of sheets of paper she has. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of packages in the two boxes:
Since each box contains 5 packages, two boxes will contain 2 * 5 = 10 packages.

2. Calculate the total number of sheets of paper:
Each package contains 250 sheets of paper. Since Julie has 10 packages, the total number of sheets is 10 * 250 = 2500 sheets.

3. Calculate how many newspapers Julie can print:
Each newspaper requires 25 sheets of paper. To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets per newspaper:
2500 / 25 = 100

So, Julie can print 100 newspapers with the paper she purchased.

M = 120

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over five weeks to find the total number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
Julie runs the school newspaper. In preparation for printing the next issue of The School News, she bought two boxes of standard paper, each containing 5 packages, with 250 sheets of paper per package.  If this issue of The School News uses 25 sheets of paper to print one newspaper, how many newspapers can Julie print with the paper that she purchased?
Output:
To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, we first need to calculate the total number of sheets of paper she has. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. Calculate the total number of packages in the two boxes:
Since each box contains 5 packages, two boxes will contain 2 * 5 = 10 packages.

2. Calculate the total number of sheets of paper:
Each package contains 250 sheets of paper. Since Julie has 10 packages, the total number of sheets is 10 * 250 = 2500 sheets.

3. Calculate how many newspapers Julie can print:
Each newspaper requires 25 sheets of paper. To find out how many newspapers Julie can print, divide the total number of sheets by the number of sheets per newspaper:
2500 / 25 = 100

So, Julie can print 100 newspapers with the paper she purchased.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Output:
To find out how many lives a mouse has, we need to first determine the number of lives a dog has, since the number of lives a mouse has is based on the number of lives a dog has.

1. A cat has 9 lives.
2. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, the number of lives a dog has is 9 - 3 = 6.
3. A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, the number of lives a mouse has is 6 + 7 = 13.

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

To find out how many lives a mouse has, we need to first determine the number of lives a dog has, since the number of lives a mouse has is based on the number of lives a dog has.

1. A cat has 9 lives.
2. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, the number of lives a dog has is 9 - 3 = 6.
3. A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, the number of lives a mouse has is 6 + 7 = 13.

Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events step by step:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift, so we add these to the initial amount: 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. Then, his mother gave him 15 biscuits, so we add these to the total: 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Finally, Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so we subtract these from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

1. A cat has 9 lives.
2. A dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, the number of lives a dog has is 9 - 3 = 6.
3. A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. So, the number of lives a mouse has is 6 + 7 = 13.

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randy’s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events step by step:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift, so we add these to the initial amount: 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. Then, his mother gave him 15 biscuits, so we add these to the total: 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Finally, Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so we subtract these from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randy’s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events step by step:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift, so we add these to the initial amount: 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. Then, his mother gave him 15 biscuits, so we add these to the total: 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Finally, Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so we subtract these from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written.

2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, which gives us another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.
