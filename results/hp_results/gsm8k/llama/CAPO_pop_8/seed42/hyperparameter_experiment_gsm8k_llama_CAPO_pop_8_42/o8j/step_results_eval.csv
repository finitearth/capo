Input:
During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces.** This is our starting point.

2. **Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.** Since Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces, Rhonda caught 12 / 2 = 6 necklaces.

3. **Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.** First, we calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: 3 * 6 = 18. Then, we subtract four from this number to find out how many Latch caught: 18 - 4 = 14.

So, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

A courier received 80 packages yesterday and twice as many today.  All of these should be delivered tomorrow. How many packages should be delivered tomorrow?
Output:
To find the total number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow, we need to calculate the number of packages received yesterday and today, and then add them together.

First, we know that the courier received 80 packages yesterday.

Today, the courier received twice as many packages as yesterday. So, the number of packages received today is 2 * 80 = 160.

Now, we add the number of packages received yesterday and today to find the total number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow: 80 + 160 = 240.

Therefore, the total number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow is 240.

Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Input:
Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we need to divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal

The centerpieces at Glenda’s wedding reception include a fishbowl containing 2 fish, except for one table that has 3 fish. There are 32 tables. How many fish are there?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fish in the fishbowls at all the tables. 

First, we know that there are 32 tables in total. However, one of these tables has 3 fish, while the rest have 2 fish each. 

So, let's calculate the number of tables with 2 fish: 
32 tables - 1 table with 3 fish = 31 tables with 2 fish.

Now, we calculate the total number of fish in the 31 tables with 2 fish:
31 tables * 2 fish per table = 62 fish.

Next, we add the number of fish in the table with 3 fish:
62 fish + 3 fish = 65 fish.

Therefore, the total number of fish is calculated by adding the fish from the tables with 2 fish and the table with 3 fish.

Input:
Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters per minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

Voldemort had his dinner and ate a piece of cake that has 110 calories. He also ate 1 pack of chips that contained 310 calories and drank a 500 ml bottle of coke that has 215 calories. His caloric intake for breakfast and lunch is 560 and 780 calories, respectively. If he has a 2500 calorie intake limit per day, how many calories can he still take?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total calories Voldemort has consumed so far and then subtract that from his daily calorie intake limit.

First, let's calculate the total calories he consumed for dinner: 
- The cake has 110 calories.
- The pack of chips has 310 calories.
- The 500 ml bottle of coke has 215 calories.
Total calories for dinner = 110 + 310 + 215 = 635 calories.

Next, let's calculate his total caloric intake for the day so far, including breakfast and lunch:
- Breakfast calories = 560 calories.
- Lunch calories = 780 calories.
- Dinner calories = 635 calories.
Total calories consumed = 560 + 780 + 635 = 1975 calories.

Now, we need to subtract the total calories consumed from his daily calorie intake limit to find out how many calories he can still take:
Daily calorie intake limit = 2500 calories.
Total calories consumed = 1975 calories.
Remaining calories = 2500 - 1975 = 525 calories.

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into logical steps:

1. We know the jar of banana candy had 43 pieces.
2. The jar of grape candy had 5 more pieces than the jar of banana candy. So, the jar of grape candy had 43 + 5 = 48 pieces.
3. The jar of peanut butter candy had 4 times as much candy as the jar of grape candy. Since the grape candy jar had 48 pieces, the peanut butter jar had 4 * 48 = 192 pieces.

Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into logical steps:

1. Jose initially had 400 tabs open.
2. He closed 1/4 of the tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed, we calculate 1/4 of 400:
   1/4 * 400 = 100 tabs closed.
   So, he had 400 - 100 = 300 tabs remaining.

3. Then, he closed 2/5 of the remaining 300 tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 2/5 of 300:
   2/5 * 300 = 120 tabs closed.
   So, he had 300 - 120 = 180 tabs remaining.

4. Finally, he closed half of the remaining tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 1/2 of 180:
   1/2 * 180 = 90 tabs closed.
   So, he had 180 - 90 = 90 tabs remaining.

Therefore, after all these steps, Jose had <final_answer>90</final_answer> tabs remaining open.

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fish in the fishbowls at all the tables. 

First, we know that there are 32 tables in total. However, one of these tables has 3 fish, while the rest have 2 fish each. 

So, let's calculate the number of tables with 2 fish: 
32 tables - 1 table with 3 fish = 31 tables with 2 fish.

Now, we calculate the total number of fish in the 31 tables with 2 fish:
31 tables * 2 fish per table = 62 fish.

Next, we add the number of fish in the table with 3 fish:
62 fish + 3 fish = 65 fish.

Therefore, the total number of fish is calculated by adding the fish from the tables with 2 fish and the table with 3 fish.

Input:
Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters per minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

Voldemort had his dinner and ate a piece of cake that has 110 calories. He also ate 1 pack of chips that contained 310 calories and drank a 500 ml bottle of coke that has 215 calories. His caloric intake for breakfast and lunch is 560 and 780 calories, respectively. If he has a 2500 calorie intake limit per day, how many calories can he still take?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total calories Voldemort has consumed so far and then subtract that from his daily calorie intake limit.

First, let's calculate the total calories he consumed for dinner: 
- The cake has 110 calories.
- The pack of chips has 310 calories.
- The 500 ml bottle of coke has 215 calories.
Total calories for dinner = 110 + 310 + 215 = 635 calories.

Next, let's calculate his total caloric intake for the day so far, including breakfast and lunch:
- Breakfast calories = 560 calories.
- Lunch calories = 780 calories.
- Dinner calories = 635 calories.
Total calories consumed = 560 + 780 + 635 = 1975 calories.

Now, we need to subtract the total calories consumed from his daily calorie intake limit to find out how many calories he can still take:
Daily calorie intake limit = 2500 calories.
Total calories consumed = 1975 calories.
Remaining calories = 2500 - 1975 = 525 calories.

Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we need to divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:

Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces.** This is our starting point.

2. **Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.** Since Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces, Rhonda caught 12 / 2 = 6 necklaces.

3. **Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.** First, we calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: 3 * 6 = 18. Then, we subtract four from this number to find out how many Latch caught: 18 - 4 = 14.

So, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we need to divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal

It took Alice three months to save up to buy new shoes. If she saved 10 dollars the first month and 30 more each month, how much did she have saved by the end of the third month?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Alice saved 10 dollars in the first month.
2. In each of the following two months, she saved 30 dollars more. So, for the second and third months, she saved 30 dollars each month.
3. The total amount saved in the second and third months is 30 + 30 = 60 dollars.
4. Adding the amount saved in the first month (10 dollars) to the total amount saved in the second and third months (60 dollars), we get the total amount saved by the end of the third month.
5. Total amount saved = 10 + 60 = 70 dollars.

During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces.** This is our starting point.

2. **Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.** Since Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces, Rhonda caught 12 / 2 = 6 necklaces.

3. **Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.** First, we calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: 3 * 6 = 18. Then, we subtract four from this number to find out how many Latch caught: 18 - 4 = 14.

So, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

A courier received 80 packages yesterday and twice as many today.  All of these should be delivered tomorrow. How many packages should be delivered tomorrow?
Output:
To find the total number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow, we need to calculate the number of packages received yesterday and today, and then add them together.

First, we know that the courier received 80 packages yesterday.

Today, the courier received twice as many packages as yesterday. So, the number of packages received today is 2 * 80 = 160.

Now, we add the number of packages received yesterday and today to find the total number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow: 80 + 160 = 240.

Therefore, the total number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow is 240.

Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

To find the total number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow, we need to calculate the number of packages received yesterday and today, and then add them together.

First, we know that the courier received 80 packages yesterday.

Today, the courier received twice as many packages as yesterday. So, the number of packages received today is 2 * 80 = 160.

Now, we add the number of packages received yesterday and today to find the total number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow: 80 + 160 = 240.

Therefore, the total number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow is 240.

During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces.** This is our starting point.

2. **Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.** Since Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces, Rhonda caught 12 / 2 = 6 necklaces.

3. **Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.** First, we calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: 3 * 6 = 18. Then, we subtract four from this number to find out how many Latch caught: 18 - 4 = 14.

So, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we need to divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Input:
Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we need to divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal

Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

It took Alice three months to save up to buy new shoes. If she saved 10 dollars the first month and 30 more each month, how much did she have saved by the end of the third month?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Alice saved 10 dollars in the first month.
2. In each of the following two months, she saved 30 dollars more. So, for the second and third months, she saved 30 dollars each month.
3. The total amount saved in the second and third months is 30 + 30 = 60 dollars.
4. Adding the amount saved in the first month (10 dollars) to the total amount saved in the second and third months (60 dollars), we get the total amount saved by the end of the third month.
5. Total amount saved = 10 + 60 = 70 dollars.

Input:
Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces.** This is our starting point.

2. **Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.** Since Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces, Rhonda caught 12 / 2 = 6 necklaces.

3. **Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.** First, we calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: 3 * 6 = 18. Then, we subtract four from this number to find out how many Latch caught: 18 - 4 = 14.

So, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we need to divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal

Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

2. In each of the following two months, she saved 30 dollars more. So, for the second and third months, she saved 30 dollars each month.
3. The total amount saved in the second and third months is 30 + 30 = 60 dollars.
4. Adding the amount saved in the first month (10 dollars) to the total amount saved in the second and third months (60 dollars), we get the total amount saved by the end of the third month.
5. Total amount saved = 10 + 60 = 70 dollars.

Input:
Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Input:
Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we need to divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal

Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we need to divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal

Input:
Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Input:
Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we need to divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal
