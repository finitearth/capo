Input:
Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Input:
Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal

Input:
Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far and then subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to write, which is 500.

On the first day, Cyrus writes 25 pages.

On the second day, he writes twice the amount he did on the first day, which is 2 x 25 = 50 pages.

On the third day, he writes twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 x 50 = 100 pages.

On the fourth day, he writes 10 pages.

Now, let's add up the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far:
25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages

Since Cyrus needs to write a total of 500 pages, we subtract the number of pages he has already written from the total:
500 - 185 = 315 pages

Therefore, Cyrus needs to write <final_answer>315</final_answer> more pages to complete his book.

Input:
In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. If Nora is currently 10 years old, how old is Terry now?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Nora is currently 10 years old.
2. In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. Since Nora is currently 10 years old, 4 times her current age is 4 * 10 = 40.
3. This means that in 10 years, Terry will be 40 years old.
4. To find Terry's current age, we need to subtract 10 years from the age Terry will be in 10 years. So, Terry's current age is 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, <final_answer>30</final_answer> is Terry's current age.

Input:
Jane is sewing sequins onto her trapeze artist costume. She sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each, 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each, and 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. How many sequins does she add total?
Output:
To find the total number of sequins Jane adds, we need to calculate the number of sequins for each color and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of blue sequins:
6 rows * 8 sequins per row = 6 * 8 = 48 blue sequins

Next, let's calculate the number of purple sequins:
5 rows * 12 sequins per row = 5 * 12 = 60 purple sequins

Finally, let's calculate the number of green sequins:
9 rows * 6 sequins per row = 9 * 6 = 54 green sequins

Now, let's add up the total number of sequins:
48 blue sequins + 60 purple sequins + 54 green sequins = 162 sequins

Input:
Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into logical steps:

1. Jose initially had 400 tabs open.
2. He closed 1/4 of the tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed, we calculate 1/4 of 400:
   1/4 * 400 = 100 tabs closed.
   So, he had 400 - 100 = 300 tabs remaining.

3. Then, he closed 2/5 of the remaining 300 tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 2/5 of 300:
   2/5 * 300 = 120 tabs closed.
   So, he had 300 - 120 = 180 tabs remaining.

4. Finally, he closed half of the remaining tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 1/2 of 180:
   1/2 * 180 = 90 tabs closed.
   So, he had 180 - 90 = 90 tabs remaining.

Therefore, after all these steps, Jose had <final_answer>90</final_answer> tabs remaining open.

Input:
Bess and Holly are playing Frisbee at the park. Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts and calculate the total distance traveled by the Frisbees thrown by Bess and Holly.

1. **Bess's throws:** Bess throws the Frisbee 20 meters and then throws it back, which means each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 20 meters forward and 20 meters backward, for a total of 40 meters per throw. Since she does this 4 times, the total distance her Frisbees travel is 40 meters/throw * 4 throws = 160 meters.

2. **Holly's throws:** Holly throws the Frisbee 8 meters, and since she leaves it where it lands, each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 8 meters. She does this 5 times, so the total distance her Frisbees travel is 8 meters/throw * 5 throws = 40 meters.

3. **Total distance traveled:** To find the total distance traveled by all the thrown Frisbees, we add the distances traveled by Bess's and Holly's Frisbees. So, 160 meters (Bess) + 40 meters (Holly) = 200 meters.

Input:
Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters per minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

A whole pizza was cut into 8 slices. Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. How many slices of pizza are left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these logical steps:

1. Determine the total number of slices of pizza initially: The pizza was cut into 8 slices.
2. Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Angeli and Marlon: Both Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add their portions together. Since 3/2 is equal to 1.5, we can add 1.5 + 1.5 to get 3 slices in total.
3. Subtract the total number of slices eaten from the initial total to find the number of slices left: We started with 8 slices and they ate 3 slices in total. So, 8 - 3 = 5 slices left.

First, we know that there are 32 tables in total. However, one of these tables has 3 fish, while the rest have 2 fish each. 

So, let's calculate the number of tables with 2 fish: 
32 tables - 1 table with 3 fish = 31 tables with 2 fish.

Now, we calculate the total number of fish in the 31 tables with 2 fish:
31 tables * 2 fish per table = 62 fish.

Then, we add the 3 fish from the table that has 3 fish:
62 fish + 3 fish = 65 fish.

Therefore, the total number of fish is calculated by adding the fish from all tables.

Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts and calculate the total distance traveled by the Frisbees thrown by Bess and Holly.

1. **Bess's throws:** Bess throws the Frisbee 20 meters and then throws it back, which means each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 20 meters forward and 20 meters backward, for a total of 40 meters per throw. Since she does this 4 times, the total distance her Frisbees travel is 40 meters/throw * 4 throws = 160 meters.

2. **Holly's throws:** Holly throws the Frisbee 8 meters, and since she leaves it where it lands, each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 8 meters. She does this 5 times, so the total distance her Frisbees travel is 8 meters/throw * 5 throws = 40 meters.

3. **Total distance traveled:** To find the total distance traveled by all the thrown Frisbees, we add the distances traveled by Bess's and Holly's Frisbees. So, 160 meters (Bess) + 40 meters (Holly) = 200 meters.

Input:
During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces.** This is our starting point.

2. **Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.** Since Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces, Rhonda caught 12 / 2 = 6 necklaces.

3. **Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.** First, we calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: 3 * 6 = 18. Then, we subtract four from this number to find out how many Latch caught: 18 - 4 = 14.

So, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

Input:
Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Input:
Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal

Input:
Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far and then subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to write, which is 500.

On the first day, Cyrus writes 25 pages.

On the second day, he writes twice the amount he did on the first day, which is 2 x 25 = 50 pages.

On the third day, he writes twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 x 50 = 100 pages.

On the fourth day, he writes 10 pages.

Now, let's add up the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far:
25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages

Since Cyrus needs to write a total of 500 pages, we subtract the number of pages he has already written from the total:
500 - 185 = 315 pages

Therefore, Cyrus needs to write <final_answer>315</final_answer> more pages to complete his book.

Input:
In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. If Nora is currently 10 years old, how old is Terry now?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Nora is currently 10 years old.
2. In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. Since Nora is currently 10 years old, 4 times her current age is 4 * 10 = 40.
3. This means that in 10 years, Terry will be 40 years old.
4. To find Terry's current age, we need to subtract 10 years from the age Terry will be in 10 years. So, Terry's current age is 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, <final_answer>30</final_answer> is Terry's current age.

Jane is sewing sequins onto her trapeze artist costume. She sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each, 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each, and 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. How many sequins does she add total?
Output:
To find the total number of sequins Jane adds, we need to calculate the number of sequins for each color and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of blue sequins:
6 rows * 8 sequins per row = 6 * 8 = 48 blue sequins

Next, let's calculate the number of purple sequins:
5 rows * 12 sequins per row = 5 * 12 = 60 purple sequins

Finally, let's calculate the number of green sequins:
9 rows * 6 sequins per row = 9 * 6 = 54 green sequins

Now, let's add up the total number of sequins:
48 blue sequins + 60 purple sequins + 54 green sequins = 162 sequins

Input:
Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters per minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

A whole pizza was cut into 8 slices. Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. How many slices of pizza are left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these logical steps:

1. Determine the total number of slices of pizza initially: The pizza was cut into 8 slices.
2. Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Angeli and Marlon: Both Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add their portions together. Since 3/2 is equal to 1.5, we can add 1.5 + 1.5 to get 3 slices in total.
3. Subtract the total number of slices eaten from the initial total to find the number of slices left: We started with 8 slices and they ate 3 slices in total. So, 8 - 3 = 5 slices left.

Input:
Bess and Holly are playing Frisbee at the park. Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts and calculate the total distance traveled by the Frisbees thrown by Bess and Holly.

1. **Bess's throws:** Bess throws the Frisbee 20 meters and then throws it back, which means each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 20 meters forward and 20 meters backward, for a total of 40 meters per throw. Since she does this 4 times, the total distance her Frisbees travel is 40 meters/throw * 4 throws = 160 meters.

2. **Holly's throws:** Holly throws the Frisbee 8 meters, and since she leaves it where it lands, each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 8 meters. She does this 5 times, so the total distance her Frisbees travel is 8 meters/throw * 5 throws = 40 meters.

3. **Total distance traveled:** To find the total distance traveled by all the thrown Frisbees, we add the distances traveled by Bess's and Holly's Frisbees. So, 160 meters (Bess) + 40 meters (Holly) = 200 meters.

Input:
The centerpieces at Glenda’s wedding reception include a fishbowl containing 2 fish, except for one table that has 3 fish. There are 32 tables. How many fish are there?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fish in the fishbowls at all the tables. 

First, we know that there are 32 tables in total. However, one of these tables has 3 fish, while the rest have 2 fish each. 

So, let's calculate the number of tables with 2 fish: 
32 tables - 1 table with 3 fish = 31 tables with 2 fish.

Now, we calculate the total number of fish in the 31 tables with 2 fish:
31 tables * 2 fish per table = 62 fish.

Then, we add the 3 fish from the table that has 3 fish:
62 fish + 3 fish = 65 fish.

Therefore, the total number of fish is calculated by adding the fish from all tables.

Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into logical steps:

1. Jose initially had 400 tabs open.
2. He closed 1/4 of the tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed, we calculate 1/4 of 400:
   1/4 * 400 = 100 tabs closed.
   So, he had 400 - 100 = 300 tabs remaining.

3. Then, he closed 2/5 of the remaining 300 tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 2/5 of 300:
   2/5 * 300 = 120 tabs closed.
   So, he had 300 - 120 = 180 tabs remaining.

4. Finally, he closed half of the remaining tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 1/2 of 180:
   1/2 * 180 = 90 tabs closed.
   So, he had 180 - 90 = 90 tabs remaining.

Therefore, after all these steps, Jose had <final_answer>90</final_answer> tabs remaining open.

Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts and calculate the total distance traveled by the Frisbees thrown by Bess and Holly.

1. **Bess's throws:** Bess throws the Frisbee 20 meters and then throws it back, which means each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 20 meters forward and 20 meters backward, for a total of 40 meters per throw. Since she does this 4 times, the total distance her Frisbees travel is 40 meters/throw * 4 throws = 160 meters.

2. **Holly's throws:** Holly throws the Frisbee 8 meters, and since she leaves it where it lands, each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 8 meters. She does this 5 times, so the total distance her Frisbees travel is 8 meters/throw * 5 throws = 40 meters.

3. **Total distance traveled:** To find the total distance traveled by all the thrown Frisbees, we add the distances traveled by Bess's and Holly's Frisbees. So, 160 meters (Bess) + 40 meters (Holly) = 200 meters.

4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal

Input:
Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far and then subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to write, which is 500.

On the first day, Cyrus writes 25 pages.

On the second day, he writes twice the amount he did on the first day, which is 2 x 25 = 50 pages.

On the third day, he writes twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 x 50 = 100 pages.

On the fourth day, he writes 10 pages.

Now, let's add up the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far:
25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages

Since Cyrus needs to write a total of 500 pages, we subtract the number of pages he has already written from the total:
500 - 185 = 315 pages

Therefore, Cyrus needs to write <final_answer>315</final_answer> more pages to complete his book.

Input:
In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. If Nora is currently 10 years old, how old is Terry now?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Nora is currently 10 years old.
2. In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. Since Nora is currently 10 years old, 4 times her current age is 4 * 10 = 40.
3. This means that in 10 years, Terry will be 40 years old.
4. To find Terry's current age, we need to subtract 10 years from the age Terry will be in 10 years. So, Terry's current age is 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, <final_answer>30</final_answer> is Terry's current age.

Input:
Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters per minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

A whole pizza was cut into 8 slices. Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. How many slices of pizza are left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these logical steps:

1. Determine the total number of slices of pizza initially: The pizza was cut into 8 slices.
2. Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Angeli and Marlon: Both Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add their portions together. Since 3/2 is equal to 1.5, we can add 1.5 + 1.5 to get 3 slices in total.
3. Subtract the total number of slices eaten from the initial total to find the number of slices left: We started with 8 slices and they ate 3 slices in total. So, 8 - 3 = 5 slices left.

Input:
Bess and Holly are playing Frisbee at the park. Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts and calculate the total distance traveled by the Frisbees thrown by Bess and Holly.

1. **Bess's throws:** Bess throws the Frisbee 20 meters and then throws it back, which means each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 20 meters forward and 20 meters backward, for a total of 40 meters per throw. Since she does this 4 times, the total distance her Frisbees travel is 40 meters/throw * 4 throws = 160 meters.

2. **Holly's throws:** Holly throws the Frisbee 8 meters, and since she leaves it where it lands, each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 8 meters. She does this 5 times, so the total distance her Frisbees travel is 8 meters/throw * 5 throws = 40 meters.

3. **Total distance traveled:** To find the total distance traveled by all the thrown Frisbees, we add the distances traveled by Bess's and Holly's Frisbees. So, 160 meters (Bess) + 40 meters (Holly) = 200 meters.

The centerpieces at Glenda’s wedding reception include a fishbowl containing 2 fish, except for one table that has 3 fish. There are 32 tables. How many fish are there?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fish in the fishbowls at all the tables. 

First, we know that there are 32 tables in total. However, one of these tables has 3 fish, while the rest have 2 fish each. 

So, let's calculate the number of tables with 2 fish: 
32 tables - 1 table with 3 fish = 31 tables with 2 fish.

Now, we calculate the total number of fish in the 31 tables with 2 fish:
31 tables * 2 fish per table = 62 fish.

Then, we add the 3 fish from the table that has 3 fish:
62 fish + 3 fish = 65 fish.

Therefore, the total number of fish is calculated by adding the fish from all tables.

Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts and calculate the total distance traveled by the Frisbees thrown by Bess and Holly.

1. **Bess's throws:** Bess throws the Frisbee 20 meters and then throws it back, which means each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 20 meters forward and 20 meters backward, for a total of 40 meters per throw. Since she does this 4 times, the total distance her Frisbees travel is 40 meters/throw * 4 throws = 160 meters.

2. **Holly's throws:** Holly throws the Frisbee 8 meters, and since she leaves it where it lands, each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 8 meters. She does this 5 times, so the total distance her Frisbees travel is 8 meters/throw * 5 throws = 40 meters.

3. **Total distance traveled:** To find the total distance traveled by all the thrown Frisbees, we add the distances traveled by Bess's and Holly's Frisbees. So, 160 meters (Bess) + 40 meters (Holly) = 200 meters.

Input:
Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Input:
Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far and then subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to write, which is 500.

On the first day, Cyrus writes 25 pages.

On the second day, he writes twice the amount he did on the first day, which is 2 x 25 = 50 pages.

On the third day, he writes twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 x 50 = 100 pages.

On the fourth day, he writes 10 pages.

Now, let's add up the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far:
25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages

Since Cyrus needs to write a total of 500 pages, we subtract the number of pages he has already written from the total:
500 - 185 = 315 pages

Therefore, Cyrus needs to write <final_answer>315</final_answer> more pages to complete his book.

Input:
In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. If Nora is currently 10 years old, how old is Terry now?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Nora is currently 10 years old.
2. In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. Since Nora is currently 10 years old, 4 times her current age is 4 * 10 = 40.
3. This means that in 10 years, Terry will be 40 years old.
4. To find Terry's current age, we need to subtract 10 years from the age Terry will be in 10 years. So, Terry's current age is 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, <final_answer>30</final_answer> is Terry's current age.

Input:
Jane is sewing sequins onto her trapeze artist costume. She sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each, 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each, and 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. How many sequins does she add total?
Output:
To find the total number of sequins Jane adds, we need to calculate the number of sequins for each color and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of blue sequins:
6 rows * 8 sequins per row = 6 * 8 = 48 blue sequins

Next, let's calculate the number of purple sequins:
5 rows * 12 sequins per row = 5 * 12 = 60 purple sequins

Finally, let's calculate the number of green sequins:
9 rows * 6 sequins per row = 9 * 6 = 54 green sequins

Now, let's add up the total number of sequins:
48 blue sequins + 60 purple sequins + 54 green sequins = 162 sequins

Input:
Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters per minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Input:
Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

Input:
A whole pizza was cut into 8 slices. Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. How many slices of pizza are left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these logical steps:

1. Determine the total number of slices of pizza initially: The pizza was cut into 8 slices.
2. Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Angeli and Marlon: Both Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add their portions together. Since 3/2 is equal to 1.5, we can add 1.5 + 1.5 to get 3 slices in total.
3. Subtract the total number of slices eaten from the initial total to find the number of slices left: We started with 8 slices and they ate 3 slices in total. So, 8 - 3 = 5 slices left.

Input:
Bess and Holly are playing Frisbee at the park. Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts and calculate the total distance traveled by the Frisbees thrown by Bess and Holly.

1. **Bess's throws:** Bess throws the Frisbee 20 meters and then throws it back, which means each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 20 meters forward and 20 meters backward, for a total of 40 meters per throw. Since she does this 4 times, the total distance her Frisbees travel is 40 meters/throw * 4 throws = 160 meters.

2. **Holly's throws:** Holly throws the Frisbee 8 meters, and since she leaves it where it lands, each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 8 meters. She does this 5 times, so the total distance her Frisbees travel is 8 meters/throw * 5 throws = 40 meters.

3. **Total distance traveled:** To find the total distance traveled by all the thrown Frisbees, we add the distances traveled by Bess's and Holly's Frisbees. So, 160 meters (Bess) + 40 meters (Holly) = 200 meters.

Input:
Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Input:
Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces.** This is our starting point.

2. **Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.** Since Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces, Rhonda caught 12 / 2 = 6 necklaces.

3. **Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.** First, we calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: 3 * 6 = 18. Then, we subtract four from this number to find out how many Latch caught: 18 - 4 = 14.

So, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

On the third day, he writes twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 x 50 = 100 pages.

On the fourth day, he writes 10 pages.

Now, let's add up the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far:
25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages

Since Cyrus needs to write a total of 500 pages, we subtract the number of pages he has already written from the total:

1. We know that Nora is currently 10 years old.
2. In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. Since Nora is currently 10 years old, 4 times her current age is 4 * 10 = 40.
3. This means that in 10 years, Terry will be 40 years old.
4. To find Terry's current age, we need to subtract 10 years from the age Terry will be in 10 years. So, Terry's current age is 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, <final_answer>30</final_answer> is Terry's current age.

Input:
Jane is sewing sequins onto her trapeze artist costume. She sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each, 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each, and 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. How many sequins does she add total?
Output:
To find the total number of sequins Jane adds, we need to calculate the number of sequins for each color and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of blue sequins:
6 rows * 8 sequins per row = 6 * 8 = 48 blue sequins

Next, let's calculate the number of purple sequins:
5 rows * 12 sequins per row = 5 * 12 = 60 purple sequins

Finally, let's calculate the number of green sequins:
9 rows * 6 sequins per row = 9 * 6 = 54 green sequins

Now, let's add up the total number of sequins:
48 blue sequins + 60 purple sequins + 54 green sequins = 162 sequins

Input:
Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters per minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Input:
Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

A whole pizza was cut into 8 slices. Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. How many slices of pizza are left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these logical steps:

1. Determine the total number of slices of pizza initially: The pizza was cut into 8 slices.
2. Calculate the total number of slices eaten by Angeli and Marlon: Both Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. To find the total number of slices they ate, we add their portions together. Since 3/2 is equal to 1.5, we can add 1.5 + 1.5 to get 3 slices in total.
3. Subtract the total number of slices eaten from the initial total to find the number of slices left: We started with 8 slices and they ate 3 slices in total. So, 8 - 3 = 5 slices left.

Input:
Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Input:
Bess and Holly are playing Frisbee at the park. Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times.

Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts and calculate the total distance traveled by the Frisbees thrown by Bess and Holly.

1. **Bess's throws:** Bess throws the Frisbee 20 meters and then throws it back, which means each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 20 meters forward and 20 meters backward, for a total of 40 meters per throw. Since she does this 4 times, the total distance her Frisbees travel is 40 meters/throw * 4 throws = 160 meters.

2. **Holly's throws:** Holly throws the Frisbee 8 meters, and since she leaves it where it lands, each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 8 meters. She does this 5 times, so the total distance her Frisbees travel is 8 meters/throw * 5 throws = 40 meters.

3. **Total distance traveled:** To find the total distance traveled by all the thrown Frisbees, we add the distances traveled by Bess's and Holly's Frisbees. So, 160 meters (Bess) + 40 meters (Holly) = 200 meters.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces.** This is our starting point.

2. **Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.** Since Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces, Rhonda caught 12 / 2 = 6 necklaces.

3. **Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.** First, we calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: 3 * 6 = 18. Then, we subtract four from this number to find out how many Latch caught: 18 - 4 = 14.

So, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

Input:
Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal

Input:
Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Input:
Bess and Holly are playing Frisbee at the park. Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts and calculate the total distance traveled by the Frisbees thrown by Bess and Holly.

1. **Bess's throws:** Bess throws the Frisbee 20 meters and then throws it back, which means each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 20 meters forward and 20 meters backward, for a total of 40 meters per throw. Since she does this 4 times, the total distance her Frisbees travel is 40 meters/throw * 4 throws = 160 meters.

2. **Holly's throws:** Holly throws the Frisbee 8 meters, and since she leaves it where it lands, each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 8 meters. She does this 5 times, so the total distance her Frisbees travel is 8 meters/throw * 5 throws = 40 meters.

3. **Total distance traveled:** To find the total distance traveled by all the thrown Frisbees, we add the distances traveled by Bess's and Holly's Frisbees. So, 160 meters (Bess) + 40 meters (Holly) = 200 meters.

Input:
Josh built his little brother a rectangular sandbox.  The perimeter of the sandbox is 30 feet and the length is twice the width. What is the width of the sandbox?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to use the formula for the perimeter of a rectangle, which is P = 2l + 2w, where P is the perimeter, l is the length, and w is the width.

We are given that the perimeter (P) is 30 feet and that the length (l) is twice the width (w). We can write this as l = 2w.

Now, we can substitute l = 2w into the formula for the perimeter:

P = 2l + 2w
30 = 2(2w) + 2w

Simplifying the equation, we get:

30 = 4w + 2w
30 = 6w

Now, we can solve for w by dividing both sides of the equation by 6:

w = 30 / 6
w = 5

So, the width of the sandbox is 5 feet.

Input:
Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. Megan initially bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she now has 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
3. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used 2 + 4 = 6 eggs in total.
4. After using 6 eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs left.
5. Megan gave her aunt half of her remaining eggs, which is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs. So, Megan now has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
6. Megan wants to divide her remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. To find out how many eggs she'll have per meal, we divide the total number of eggs she has left (9) by the number of meals (3).

Now, let's calculate the number of eggs per meal:
9 eggs / 3 meals = 3 eggs per meal

Input:
Bess and Holly are playing Frisbee at the park. Bess can throw the Frisbee as far as 20 meters and she does this 4 times. Holly can only throw the Frisbee as far as 8 meters and she does this 5 times. Each time Bess throws a Frisbee, she throws it back to her original position. Holly leaves her Frisbee where it lands every time she throws it. In total, how many meters have the thrown Frisbees traveled?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into parts and calculate the total distance traveled by the Frisbees thrown by Bess and Holly.

1. **Bess's throws:** Bess throws the Frisbee 20 meters and then throws it back, which means each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 20 meters forward and 20 meters backward, for a total of 40 meters per throw. Since she does this 4 times, the total distance her Frisbees travel is 40 meters/throw * 4 throws = 160 meters.

2. **Holly's throws:** Holly throws the Frisbee 8 meters, and since she leaves it where it lands, each throw results in the Frisbee traveling 8 meters. She does this 5 times, so the total distance her Frisbees travel is 8 meters/throw * 5 throws = 40 meters.

3. **Total distance traveled:** To find the total distance traveled by all the thrown Frisbees, we add the distances traveled by Bess's and Holly's Frisbees. So, 160 meters (Bess) + 40 meters (Holly) = 200 meters.
