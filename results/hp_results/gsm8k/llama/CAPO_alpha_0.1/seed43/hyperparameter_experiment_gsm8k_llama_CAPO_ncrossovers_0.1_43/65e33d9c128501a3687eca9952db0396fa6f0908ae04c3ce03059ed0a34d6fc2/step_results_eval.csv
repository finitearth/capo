Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so we can write another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Input:
Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in total over five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over the same period to find the number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda. Since Candice read 18 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Amanda read:
   Candice's books = 3 * Amanda's books
   18 = 3 * Amanda's books
   Amanda's books = 18 / 3
   Amanda's books = 6

2. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read. Since Amanda read 6 books, we can find out how many books Kara read:
   Kara's books = Amanda's books / 2
   Kara's books = 6 / 2
   Kara's books = 3

3. Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. Since Kara read 3 books, we can find out how many books Patricia read:
   Patricia's books = 7 * Kara's books
   Patricia's books = 7 * 3
   Patricia's books = 21

So, Patricia read 21 books.

Jack collects all his neighbors' recycling and sorts out the cans and bottles to return for the deposit. He gets 10 cents per bottle and 5 cents per can. If he recycled 80 bottles and made $15, how many cans did he recycle?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know that Jack gets 10 cents per bottle and he recycled 80 bottles. So, the total amount of money he made from bottles is:
80 bottles * 10 cents/bottle = 800 cents

Since there are 100 cents in a dollar, we can convert this to dollars:
800 cents / 100 cents/dollar = $8

This means that Jack made $8 from the bottles.

We are also told that Jack made a total of $15. So, the amount of money he made from cans is:
$15 (total) - $8 (from bottles) = $7

Since Jack gets 5 cents per can, we can find the number of cans he recycled by dividing the amount of money he made from cans ($7) by the amount he gets per can (5 cents, or $0.05):
$7 / $0.05 = 140 cans

Therefore, Jack recycled 140 cans.

Output:
To find the total number of birds Camille saw, we need to calculate the number of each type of bird she saw and then add them together.

1. **Cardinals**: Camille saw 3 cardinals.

2. **Robins**: She saw four times as many robins as cardinals. Since she saw 3 cardinals, she saw 4 * 3 = 12 robins.

3. **Blue Jays**: Camille saw twice as many blue jays as cardinals. So, she saw 2 * 3 = 6 blue jays.

4. **Sparrows**: She saw 1 more than three times as many sparrows as cardinals. Since she saw 3 cardinals, three times that number is 3 * 3 = 9. One more than that is 9 + 1 = 10 sparrows.

Now, we add up the number of each type of bird to find the total number of birds Camille saw:
- Cardinals: 3
- Robins: 12
- Blue Jays: 6
- Sparrows: 10

Total = 3 + 12 + 6 + 10 = 31

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:

On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in total over five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over the same period to find the number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda. Since Candice read 18 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Amanda read:
   Candice's books = 3 * Amanda's books
   18 = 3 * Amanda's books
   Amanda's books = 18 / 3
   Amanda's books = 6

2. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read. Since Amanda read 6 books, we can find out how many books Kara read:
   Kara's books = Amanda's books / 2
   Kara's books = 6 / 2
   Kara's books = 3

3. Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. Since Kara read 3 books, we can find out how many books Patricia read:
   Patricia's books = 7 * Kara's books
   Patricia's books = 7 * 3
   Patricia's books = 21

So, Patricia read 21 books.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in total over five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over the same period to find the number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so we can write another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in total over five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over the same period to find the number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda. Since Candice read 18 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Amanda read:

   18 = 3 * Amanda's books
   Amanda's books = 18 / 3
   Amanda's books = 6

2. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read. Since Amanda read 6 books, we can find out how many books Kara read:
   Kara's books = Amanda's books / 2
   Kara's books = 6 / 2
   Kara's books = 3

3. Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. Since Kara read 3 books, we can find out how many books Patricia read:
   Patricia's books = 7 * Kara's books
   Patricia's books = 7 * 3
   Patricia's books = 21

So, Patricia read 21 books.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in total over five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over the same period to find the number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so we can write another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events in order:

1. Randy started with 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits, so now Randy has 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. His mother gave him 15 biscuits, so now Randy has 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so now Randy has 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda. Since Candice read 18 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Amanda read:
   Candice's books = 3 * Amanda's books
   18 = 3 * Amanda's books
   Amanda's books = 18 / 3
   Amanda's books = 6

2. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read. Since Amanda read 6 books, we can find out how many books Kara read:
   Kara's books = Amanda's books / 2
   Kara's books = 6 / 2
   Kara's books = 3

3. Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. Since Kara read 3 books, we can find out how many books Patricia read:
   Patricia's books = 7 * Kara's books
   Patricia's books = 7 * 3
   Patricia's books = 21

So, Patricia read 21 books.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so we can write another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randy’s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events in order:

1. Randy started with 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits, so now Randy has 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. His mother gave him 15 biscuits, so now Randy has 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so now Randy has 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Input:
Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in total over five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over the same period to find the number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda. Since Candice read 18 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Amanda read:
   Candice's books = 3 * Amanda's books
   18 = 3 * Amanda's books
   Amanda's books = 18 / 3
   Amanda's books = 6

2. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read. Since Amanda read 6 books, we can find out how many books Kara read:
   Kara's books = Amanda's books / 2
   Kara's books = 6 / 2
   Kara's books = 3

3. Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. Since Kara read 3 books, we can find out how many books Patricia read:
   Patricia's books = 7 * Kara's books
   Patricia's books = 7 * 3
   Patricia's books = 21

So, Patricia read 21 books.

The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Input:
Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in total over five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over the same period to find the number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

1. Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda. Since Candice read 18 books, we can set up an equation to find out how many books Amanda read:
   Candice's books = 3 * Amanda's books
   18 = 3 * Amanda's books
   Amanda's books = 18 / 3
   Amanda's books = 6

2. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read. Since Amanda read 6 books, we can find out how many books Kara read:
   Kara's books = Amanda's books / 2
   Kara's books = 6 / 2
   Kara's books = 3

3. Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. Since Kara read 3 books, we can find out how many books Patricia read:
   Patricia's books = 7 * Kara's books
   Patricia's books = 7 * 3
   Patricia's books = 21

So, Patricia read 21 books.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so we can write another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in total over five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over the same period to find the number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so we can write another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in total over five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over the same period to find the number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so we can write another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in total over five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over the same period to find the number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so we can write another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Initially, Georgia completed 10 problems in 20 minutes.
2. After another 20 minutes, she completed twice as many problems as she had after the first 20 minutes. Since she had completed 10 problems after the first 20 minutes, twice that number is 10 * 2 = 20. So, after the second 20 minutes, she completed an additional 20 problems, making the total problems completed 10 (from the first 20 minutes) + 20 (from the second 20 minutes) = 30 problems.

Now, let's determine how many problems she has left to solve.

The total number of problems on the test is 75.
She has completed 30 problems so far.

To find out how many problems she has left, we subtract the number of problems completed from the total number of problems:
75 (total problems) - 30 (problems completed) = 45

Therefore, Georgia has 45 problems left to solve.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

Step 1: Determine the average milk production per cow per week.
Given that every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week, we divide the total milk production by the number of cows to find the production per cow.
108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters per cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
Since we know the average production per cow per week, we multiply this by the number of weeks to find the total production per cow over five weeks.
18 liters/week * 5 weeks = 90 liters per cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Determine the total number of cows based on the total milk production over five weeks.
Given that the cows produced 2160 liters of milk in total over five weeks, we divide this total by the production per cow over the same period to find the number of cows.
2160 liters / 90 liters per cow = 24 cows.

Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events in order:

1. Randy started with 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits, so now Randy has 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. His mother gave him 15 biscuits, so now Randy has 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so now Randy has 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so we can write another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.

Input:
The square footage of the two bedrooms in the apartment that Jenny and Martha share totals 300 square feet. If Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, how large, in square feet, is Martha's bedroom?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

Let's denote the size of Martha's bedroom as M and the size of Jenny's bedroom as J. We know two things:

1. The total size of both bedrooms is 300 square feet, so we can write an equation: M + J = 300.
2. Jenny's bedroom is 60 square feet larger than Martha's, so we can write another equation: J = M + 60.

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of M (Martha's bedroom size). Substituting J = M + 60 into M + J = 300 gives us:

M + (M + 60) = 300

Combine like terms:

2M + 60 = 300

Subtract 60 from both sides:

2M = 240

Divide both sides by 2:

M = 120

So, Martha's bedroom is 120 square feet.
