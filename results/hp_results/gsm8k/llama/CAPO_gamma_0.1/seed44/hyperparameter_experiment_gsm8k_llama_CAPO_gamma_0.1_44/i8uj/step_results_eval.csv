Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest. We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance. 

First, we need to find out how many miles 1 inch represents. Since 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, we can multiply 8 miles by 4 to find the number of miles 1 inch represents: 
8 miles * 4 = 32 miles per inch.

Now, we know that the towns are 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. To find the actual distance, we need to convert the mixed number 3 3/8 into an improper fraction or a decimal. 
3 3/8 = (3 * 8 + 3)/8 = (24 + 3)/8 = 27/8 = 3.375 inches.

Now that we know the distance between the towns in inches, we can multiply this by the number of miles per inch to find the actual distance in miles:
3.375 inches * 32 miles/inch = 108 miles.

So, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is <final_answer>108</final_answer> miles.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of insects in Calvin's collection. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. He has 3 scorpions.
3. He has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has 12 / 2 = 6 crickets.
4. He has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has 3 x 2 = 6 caterpillars.

Now, let's add up the total number of insects:

- Roaches: 12
- Scorpions: 3
- Crickets: 6
- Caterpillars: 6

Total number of insects = 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half. This means the pizza is now in 2 pieces.
2. Then, he cuts both halves in half. So, each of the 2 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pieces.
3. Next, he cuts each of these 4 slices in half again. This means each of the 4 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 slices.

Now, we know there are 8 slices of pizza in total.

Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which is 3 * 1 = 3 slices.
- 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

In total, Phill gave out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

To find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given to his friends from the total number of slices:
8 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 1

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes and she folds half by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left to be folded.

A friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are still left to be folded. We started with 500 remaining after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of those. So, 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes are left to be folded.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of hours Claire spends on cleaning and cooking. 
   Cleaning: 4 hours
   Cooking: 2 hours
   Total time spent on cleaning and cooking: 4 + 2 = 6 hours

2. Next, we know that Claire sleeps for 8 hours and the entire day consists of 24 hours. 
   So, the time left for other activities (including crafting and tailoring) after cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is:
   24 hours (total in a day) - 8 hours (sleeping) - 6 hours (cleaning and cooking) = 10 hours

3. Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the 10 hours on crafting.
   Time spent crafting: 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

First, we know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we need to find half of Bill's toys. Half of 60 is 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more than 30 toys. So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Finally, to find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39). 60 + 39 = 99.

Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know that Barry will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. Let's denote the number of cucumbers as C and the number of tomatoes as T. We can write an equation based on the total number of vegetables:

C + T = 280

We are also told that there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers. This means that the number of tomatoes is three times the number of cucumbers. We can write this relationship as:

T = 3C

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for C:

C + 3C = 280

Combine like terms:

4C = 280

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for C:

C = 280 / 4
C = 70

So, the number of cucumbers that will be used in the salad is 70.

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we first need to calculate the total hours she has already spent on the project. She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. 

Total hours spent so far = hours spent on research + hours spent on proposal
Total hours spent so far = 10 hours + 2 hours
Total hours spent so far = 12 hours

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours available to find out how many hours she has left.

Hours left = Total hours available - Total hours spent so far
Hours left = 20 hours - 12 hours
Hours left = 8 hours

Therefore, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Thirty-six marbles are divided between Mario and Manny in the ratio 4:5. If Manny decided to give 2 marbles to his brother, how many marbles does Manny have now?
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many marbles Manny had initially. The marbles are divided in the ratio 4:5 between Mario and Manny. This means that out of every 9 parts, Mario gets 4 parts and Manny gets 5 parts.

First, we find the total number of parts: 4 + 5 = 9 parts.

Since there are 36 marbles in total, we divide 36 by 9 to find out how many marbles each part represents:
36 / 9 = 4 marbles per part.

Now, we know Manny gets 5 parts, so we multiply the number of marbles per part by the number of parts Manny gets:
5 parts * 4 marbles/part = 20 marbles.

Manny initially had 20 marbles. If he gives 2 marbles to his brother, we subtract 2 from 20 to find out how many marbles Manny has now:
20 - 2 = 18 marbles.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Step 1: Determine the number of toys Hash has.
Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has, and Bill has 60 toys, we first need to find half of Bill's toys.
Half of Bill's toys = 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys Hash has.
Hash has 9 more toys than half of Bill's toys.
So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Step 3: Find the total number of toys the boys have.
To find the total number of toys, we add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has.
Total toys = Bill's toys + Hash's toys = 60 + 39 = 99 toys.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest. We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance. 

First, we need to find out how many miles 1 inch represents. Since 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, we can multiply 8 miles by 4 to find the number of miles 1 inch represents: 
8 miles * 4 = 32 miles per inch.

Now, we know that the towns are 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. To find the actual distance, we need to convert the mixed number 3 3/8 into an improper fraction or a decimal. 
3 3/8 = (3 * 8 + 3)/8 = (24 + 3)/8 = 27/8 = 3.375 inches.

Now that we know the distance between the towns in inches, we can multiply this by the number of miles per inch to find the actual distance in miles:

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest. We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance. 

First, we need to find out how many miles 1 inch represents. Since 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, we can multiply 8 miles by 4 to find the number of miles 1 inch represents: 
8 miles * 4 = 32 miles per inch.

Now, we know that the towns are 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. To find the actual distance, we need to convert the mixed number 3 3/8 into an improper fraction or a decimal. 
3 3/8 = (3 * 8 + 3)/8 = (24 + 3)/8 = 27/8 = 3.375 inches.

Now that we know the distance between the towns in inches, we can multiply this by the number of miles per inch to find the actual distance in miles:
3.375 inches * 32 miles/inch = 108 miles.

So, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is <final_answer>108</final_answer> miles.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of insects in Calvin's collection. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. He has 3 scorpions.
3. He has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has 12 / 2 = 6 crickets.
4. He has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has 3 x 2 = 6 caterpillars.

Now, let's add up the total number of insects:

- Roaches: 12
- Scorpions: 3
- Crickets: 6
- Caterpillars: 6

Total number of insects = 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half. This means the pizza is now in 2 pieces.
2. Then, he cuts both halves in half. So, each of the 2 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pieces.
3. Next, he cuts each of these 4 slices in half again. This means each of the 4 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 slices.

Now, we know there are 8 slices of pizza in total.

Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which is 3 * 1 = 3 slices.
- 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

In total, Phill gave out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

To find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given to his friends from the total number of slices:
8 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 1

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes and she folds half by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left to be folded.

A friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are still left to be folded. We started with 500 remaining after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of those. So, 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes are left to be folded.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of hours Claire spends on cleaning and cooking. 
   Cleaning: 4 hours
   Cooking: 2 hours
   Total time spent on cleaning and cooking: 4 + 2 = 6 hours

2. Next, we know that Claire sleeps for 8 hours and the entire day consists of 24 hours. 
   So, the time left for other activities (including crafting and tailoring) after cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is:
   24 hours (total in a day) - 8 hours (sleeping) - 6 hours (cleaning and cooking) = 10 hours

3. Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the 10 hours on crafting.
   Time spent crafting: 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

First, we know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we need to find half of Bill's toys. Half of 60 is 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more than 30 toys. So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Finally, to find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39). 60 + 39 = 99.

Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, we know that Barry will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. Let's denote the number of cucumbers as C and the number of tomatoes as T. We can write an equation based on the total number of vegetables:

C + T = 280

We are also told that there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers. This means that the number of tomatoes is three times the number of cucumbers. We can write this relationship as:

T = 3C

Now, we can substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for C:

C + 3C = 280

Combine like terms:

4C = 280

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for C:

C = 280 / 4
C = 70

So, the number of cucumbers that will be used in the salad is 70.

Jenny is working on a school project. She spends 10 hours doing research for the project and 2 hours writing a proposal. If she has 20 hours total to work on the project, how many hours does she have left to write her report?
Output:
To find out how many hours Jenny has left to write her report, we first need to calculate the total hours she has already spent on the project. She spent 10 hours doing research and 2 hours writing a proposal. 

Total hours spent so far = hours spent on research + hours spent on proposal
Total hours spent so far = 10 hours + 2 hours
Total hours spent so far = 12 hours

Since Jenny has 20 hours total to work on the project, we subtract the hours she has already spent from the total hours available to find out how many hours she has left.

Hours left = Total hours available - Total hours spent so far
Hours left = 20 hours - 12 hours
Hours left = 8 hours

Therefore, Jenny has 8 hours left to write her report.

Thirty-six marbles are divided between Mario and Manny in the ratio 4:5. If Manny decided to give 2 marbles to his brother, how many marbles does Manny have now?
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find out how many marbles Manny had initially. The marbles are divided in the ratio 4:5 between Mario and Manny. This means that out of every 9 parts, Mario gets 4 parts and Manny gets 5 parts.

First, we find the total number of parts: 4 + 5 = 9 parts.

Since there are 36 marbles in total, we divide 36 by 9 to find out how many marbles each part represents:
36 / 9 = 4 marbles per part.

Now, we know Manny gets 5 parts, so we multiply the number of marbles per part by the number of parts Manny gets:
5 parts * 4 marbles/part = 20 marbles.

Manny initially had 20 marbles. If he gives 2 marbles to his brother, we subtract 2 from 20 to find out how many marbles Manny has now:
20 - 2 = 18 marbles.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Step 1: Determine the number of toys Hash has.
Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has, and Bill has 60 toys, we first need to find half of Bill's toys.
Half of Bill's toys = 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys Hash has.
Hash has 9 more toys than half of Bill's toys.
So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Step 3: Find the total number of toys the boys have.
To find the total number of toys, we add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has.
Total toys = Bill's toys + Hash's toys = 60 + 39 = 99 toys.

Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest. We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance. 

First, we need to find out how many miles 1 inch represents. Since 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, we can multiply 8 miles by 4 to find the number of miles 1 inch represents: 
8 miles * 4 = 32 miles per inch.

Now, we know that the towns are 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. To find the actual distance, we need to convert the mixed number 3 3/8 into an improper fraction or a decimal. 
3 3/8 = (3 * 8 + 3)/8 = (24 + 3)/8 = 27/8 = 3.375 inches.

Now that we know the distance between the towns in inches, we can multiply this by the number of miles per inch to find the actual distance in miles:
3.375 inches * 32 miles/inch = 108 miles.

So, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is <final_answer>108</final_answer> miles.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of insects in Calvin's collection. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. He has 3 scorpions.
3. He has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has 12 / 2 = 6 crickets.
4. He has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has 3 x 2 = 6 caterpillars.

Now, let's add up the total number of insects:

- Roaches: 12
- Scorpions: 3
- Crickets: 6
- Caterpillars: 6

Total number of insects = 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half. This means the pizza is now in 2 pieces.
2. Then, he cuts both halves in half. So, each of the 2 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pieces.
3. Next, he cuts each of these 4 slices in half again. This means each of the 4 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 slices.

Now, we know there are 8 slices of pizza in total.

Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which is 3 * 1 = 3 slices.
- 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

In total, Phill gave out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

To find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given to his friends from the total number of slices:
8 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 1

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes and she folds half by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left to be folded.

A friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are still left to be folded. We started with 500 remaining after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of those. So, 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes are left to be folded.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of hours Claire spends on cleaning and cooking. 
   Cleaning: 4 hours
   Cooking: 2 hours
   Total time spent on cleaning and cooking: 4 + 2 = 6 hours

2. Next, we know that Claire sleeps for 8 hours and the entire day consists of 24 hours. 
   So, the time left for other activities (including crafting and tailoring) after cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is:
   24 hours (total in a day) - 8 hours (sleeping) - 6 hours (cleaning and cooking) = 10 hours

3. Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the 10 hours on crafting.
   Time spent crafting: 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

First, we know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we need to find half of Bill's toys. Half of 60 is 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more than 30 toys. So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Finally, to find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39). 60 + 39 = 99.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Step 1: Determine the number of toys Hash has.
Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has, and Bill has 60 toys, we first need to find half of Bill's toys.
Half of Bill's toys = 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys Hash has.
Hash has 9 more toys than half of Bill's toys.
So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Step 3: Find the total number of toys the boys have.
To find the total number of toys, we add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has.
Total toys = Bill's toys + Hash's toys = 60 + 39 = 99 toys.

Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest. We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance. 

First, we need to find out how many miles 1 inch represents. Since 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, we can multiply 8 miles by 4 to find the number of miles 1 inch represents: 
8 miles * 4 = 32 miles per inch.

Now, we know that the towns are 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. To find the actual distance, we need to convert the mixed number 3 3/8 into an improper fraction or a decimal. 
3 3/8 = (3 * 8 + 3)/8 = (24 + 3)/8 = 27/8 = 3.375 inches.

Now that we know the distance between the towns in inches, we can multiply this by the number of miles per inch to find the actual distance in miles:
3.375 inches * 32 miles/inch = 108 miles.

So, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is <final_answer>108</final_answer> miles.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of insects in Calvin's collection. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. He has 3 scorpions.
3. He has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has 12 / 2 = 6 crickets.
4. He has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has 3 x 2 = 6 caterpillars.

Now, let's add up the total number of insects:

- Roaches: 12
- Scorpions: 3
- Crickets: 6
- Caterpillars: 6

Total number of insects = 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half. This means the pizza is now in 2 pieces.
2. Then, he cuts both halves in half. So, each of the 2 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pieces.
3. Next, he cuts each of these 4 slices in half again. This means each of the 4 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 slices.

Now, we know there are 8 slices of pizza in total.

Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which is 3 * 1 = 3 slices.
- 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

In total, Phill gave out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

To find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given to his friends from the total number of slices:
8 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 1

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes and she folds half by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left to be folded.

A friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are still left to be folded. We started with 500 remaining after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of those. So, 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes are left to be folded.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of hours Claire spends on cleaning and cooking. 
   Cleaning: 4 hours
   Cooking: 2 hours
   Total time spent on cleaning and cooking: 4 + 2 = 6 hours

2. Next, we know that Claire sleeps for 8 hours and the entire day consists of 24 hours. 
   So, the time left for other activities (including crafting and tailoring) after cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is:
   24 hours (total in a day) - 8 hours (sleeping) - 6 hours (cleaning and cooking) = 10 hours

3. Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the 10 hours on crafting.
   Time spent crafting: 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

First, we know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we need to find half of Bill's toys. Half of 60 is 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more than 30 toys. So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Finally, to find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39). 60 + 39 = 99.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

Step 1: Determine the number of toys Hash has.
Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has, and Bill has 60 toys, we first need to find half of Bill's toys.
Half of Bill's toys = 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Step 2: Calculate the number of toys Hash has.
Hash has 9 more toys than half of Bill's toys.
So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Step 3: Find the total number of toys the boys have.
To find the total number of toys, we add the number of toys Bill has to the number of toys Hash has.
Total toys = Bill's toys + Hash's toys = 60 + 39 = 99 toys.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest. We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance. 

First, we need to find out how many miles 1 inch represents. Since 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, we can multiply 8 miles by 4 to find the number of miles 1 inch represents:

3 3/8 = (3 * 8 + 3)/8 = (24 + 3)/8 = 27/8 = 3.375 inches.

Now that we know the distance between the towns in inches, we can multiply this by the number of miles per inch to find the actual distance in miles:
3.375 inches * 32 miles/inch = 108 miles.

So, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is <final_answer>108</final_answer> miles.

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of insects in Calvin's collection. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. He has 3 scorpions.
3. He has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has 12 / 2 = 6 crickets.
4. He has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has 3 x 2 = 6 caterpillars.

Now, let's add up the total number of insects:

- Roaches: 12
- Scorpions: 3
- Crickets: 6
- Caterpillars: 6

Total number of insects = 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half. This means the pizza is now in 2 pieces.
2. Then, he cuts both halves in half. So, each of the 2 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pieces.
3. Next, he cuts each of these 4 slices in half again. This means each of the 4 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 slices.

Now, we know there are 8 slices of pizza in total.

Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which is 3 * 1 = 3 slices.
- 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

In total, Phill gave out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

To find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given to his friends from the total number of slices:
8 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 1

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes and she folds half by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left to be folded.

A friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are still left to be folded. We started with 500 remaining after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of those. So, 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes are left to be folded.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

1. First, let's calculate the total number of hours Claire spends on cleaning and cooking. 
   Cleaning: 4 hours
   Cooking: 2 hours
   Total time spent on cleaning and cooking: 4 + 2 = 6 hours

2. Next, we know that Claire sleeps for 8 hours and the entire day consists of 24 hours. 
   So, the time left for other activities (including crafting and tailoring) after cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is:
   24 hours (total in a day) - 8 hours (sleeping) - 6 hours (cleaning and cooking) = 10 hours

3. Since Claire divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the 10 hours on crafting.
   Time spent crafting: 10 hours / 2 = 5 hours

Therefore, Claire spends 5 hours crafting.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

First, we know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we need to find half of Bill's toys. Half of 60 is 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more than 30 toys. So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Finally, to find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39). 60 + 39 = 99.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of insects in Calvin's collection. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. He has 3 scorpions.
3. He has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has 12 / 2 = 6 crickets.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest. We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance. 

First, we need to find out how many miles 1 inch represents. Since 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, we can multiply 8 miles by 4 to find the number of miles 1 inch represents: 
8 miles * 4 = 32 miles per inch.

Now, we know that the towns are 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. To find the actual distance, we need to convert the mixed number 3 3/8 into an improper fraction or a decimal. 
3 3/8 = (3 * 8 + 3)/8 = (24 + 3)/8 = 27/8 = 3.375 inches.

Now that we know the distance between the towns in inches, we can multiply this by the number of miles per inch to find the actual distance in miles:
3.375 inches * 32 miles/inch = 108 miles.

So, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is <final_answer>108</final_answer> miles.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half. This means the pizza is now in 2 pieces.
2. Then, he cuts both halves in half. So, each of the 2 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pieces.
3. Next, he cuts each of these 4 slices in half again. This means each of the 4 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 slices.

Now, we know there are 8 slices of pizza in total.

Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which is 3 * 1 = 3 slices.
- 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

In total, Phill gave out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

To find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given to his friends from the total number of slices:
8 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 1

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

First, we know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we need to find half of Bill's toys. Half of 60 is 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more than 30 toys. So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Finally, to find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39). 60 + 39 = 99.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes and she folds half by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left to be folded.

A friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are still left to be folded. We started with 500 remaining after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of those. So, 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes are left to be folded.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of insects in Calvin's collection. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. He has 3 scorpions.
3. He has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has 12 / 2 = 6 crickets.
4. He has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has 3 x 2 = 6 caterpillars.

Now, let's add up the total number of insects:

- Roaches: 12
- Scorpions: 3
- Crickets: 6
- Caterpillars: 6

Total number of insects = 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27

On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest. We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance. 

First, we need to find out how many miles 1 inch represents. Since 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, we can multiply 8 miles by 4 to find the number of miles 1 inch represents: 
8 miles * 4 = 32 miles per inch.

Now, we know that the towns are 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. To find the actual distance, we need to convert the mixed number 3 3/8 into an improper fraction or a decimal. 
3 3/8 = (3 * 8 + 3)/8 = (24 + 3)/8 = 27/8 = 3.375 inches.

Now that we know the distance between the towns in inches, we can multiply this by the number of miles per inch to find the actual distance in miles:
3.375 inches * 32 miles/inch = 108 miles.

So, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is <final_answer>108</final_answer> miles.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half. This means the pizza is now in 2 pieces.
2. Then, he cuts both halves in half. So, each of the 2 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pieces.
3. Next, he cuts each of these 4 slices in half again. This means each of the 4 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 slices.

Now, we know there are 8 slices of pizza in total.

Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which is 3 * 1 = 3 slices.
- 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

In total, Phill gave out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

To find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given to his friends from the total number of slices:
8 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 1

Input:
On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest. We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance. 

First, we need to find out how many miles 1 inch represents. Since 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, we can multiply 8 miles by 4 to find the number of miles 1 inch represents: 
8 miles * 4 = 32 miles per inch.

Now, we know that the towns are 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. To find the actual distance, we need to convert the mixed number 3 3/8 into an improper fraction or a decimal. 
3 3/8 = (3 * 8 + 3)/8 = (24 + 3)/8 = 27/8 = 3.375 inches.

Now that we know the distance between the towns in inches, we can multiply this by the number of miles per inch to find the actual distance in miles:
3.375 inches * 32 miles/inch = 108 miles.

So, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is <final_answer>108</final_answer> miles.

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft, we need to first calculate the speed of each spacecraft.

The first spacecraft traveled from 3:00 pm to 3:30 pm, which is a total of 0.5 hours. The distance traveled is 448 miles. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour.

The second spacecraft landed 30 minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It traveled from 3:00 pm to 4:00 pm, which is a total of 1 hour. The distance traveled is also 448 miles.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

First, we know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we need to find half of Bill's toys. Half of 60 is 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more than 30 toys. So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Finally, to find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39). 60 + 39 = 99.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes and she folds half by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left to be folded.

A friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are still left to be folded. We started with 500 remaining after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of those. So, 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes are left to be folded.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of insects in Calvin's collection. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. He has 3 scorpions.
3. He has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has 12 / 2 = 6 crickets.
4. He has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has 3 x 2 = 6 caterpillars.

Now, let's add up the total number of insects:

- Roaches: 12
- Scorpions: 3
- Crickets: 6
- Caterpillars: 6

Total number of insects = 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27

How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half. This means the pizza is now in 2 pieces.
2. Then, he cuts both halves in half. So, each of the 2 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pieces.
3. Next, he cuts each of these 4 slices in half again. This means each of the 4 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 slices.

Now, we know there are 8 slices of pizza in total.

Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which is 3 * 1 = 3 slices.
- 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

In total, Phill gave out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

To find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given to his friends from the total number of slices:
8 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 1

Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour.

Now, we can find the difference in speed between the two spacecraft by subtracting the speed of the second spacecraft from the speed of the first spacecraft.

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

<final_answer> 448 </final_answer>

Input:
Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has, and then add that to the number of toys Bill has.

First, we know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we need to find half of Bill's toys. Half of 60 is 60 / 2 = 30.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more than 30 toys. So, Hash has 30 + 9 = 39 toys.

Finally, to find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39). 60 + 39 = 99.

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes and she folds half by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left to be folded.

A friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are still left to be folded. We started with 500 remaining after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of those. So, 500 - 100 = 400 paper cranes are left to be folded.

Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 * 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of insects in Calvin's collection. Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. He has 3 scorpions.
3. He has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has 12 / 2 = 6 crickets.
4. He has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has 3 x 2 = 6 caterpillars.

Now, let's add up the total number of insects:

- Roaches: 12
- Scorpions: 3
- Crickets: 6
- Caterpillars: 6

Total number of insects = 12 + 3 + 6 + 6 = 27

On a road map, 1/4 inch represents 8 miles of actual road distance. The towns of Pence and Hillcrest are represented by points 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. What is the actual distance, in miles, between the towns?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest. We know that 1/4 inch on the map represents 8 miles of actual road distance. 

First, we need to find out how many miles 1 inch represents. Since 1/4 inch represents 8 miles, we can multiply 8 miles by 4 to find the number of miles 1 inch represents: 
8 miles * 4 = 32 miles per inch.

Now, we know that the towns are 3 3/8 inches apart on the map. To find the actual distance, we need to convert the mixed number 3 3/8 into an improper fraction or a decimal. 
3 3/8 = (3 * 8 + 3)/8 = (24 + 3)/8 = 27/8 = 3.375 inches.

Now that we know the distance between the towns in inches, we can multiply this by the number of miles per inch to find the actual distance in miles:
3.375 inches * 32 miles/inch = 108 miles.

So, the actual distance between the towns of Pence and Hillcrest is <final_answer>108</final_answer> miles.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 * 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 * 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs <final_answer>30</final_answer> cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Phill had some friends over for pizza.  He opens the pizza box and discovers it hasn't been sliced.  Phill cuts the pizza in half, and then cuts both halves in half, and then cuts each slice in half again.  Phill then passes out 1 slice to 3 of his friends and 2 slices to 2 of his friends.  How many slices of pizza are left for Phill?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. Phill cuts the pizza in half. This means the pizza is now in 2 pieces.
2. Then, he cuts both halves in half. So, each of the 2 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 2 * 2 = 4 pieces.
3. Next, he cuts each of these 4 slices in half again. This means each of the 4 pieces is cut into 2, resulting in 4 * 2 = 8 slices.

Now, we know there are 8 slices of pizza in total.

Phill passes out slices to his friends:
- 1 slice to 3 of his friends, which is 3 * 1 = 3 slices.
- 2 slices to 2 of his friends, which is 2 * 2 = 4 slices.

In total, Phill gave out 3 + 4 = 7 slices to his friends.

To find out how many slices are left for Phill, we subtract the number of slices given to his friends from the total number of slices:
8 (total slices) - 7 (slices given away) = 1
