Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.

Next, a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are left for Alice to fold. There were 500 paper cranes left after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of them. So, the number of paper cranes left for Alice to fold is 500 - 100 = 400.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold <final_answer>400</final_answer> paper cranes.

Input:
Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Input:
Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has. We know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we can start by finding half of Bill's toys.

Half of Bill's toys is 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more toys than this amount, so we add 9 to 30:

30 + 9 = 39 toys.

This means Hash has 39 toys. To find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39):

60 + 39 = 99 toys.

So, the total number of toys the boys have is <final_answer>99</final_answer>.

Input:
Colton had 72 dolphin stickers. He gave 4 stickers each to 3 friends.  He also gave his friend Mandy 2 more than he gave his three friends total.   And he gave Justin 10 less than Mandy.  How many stickers does Colton have left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate how many stickers Colton gave to his three friends. He gave 4 stickers to each of the 3 friends, so the total number of stickers given to these friends is:
4 stickers/friend * 3 friends = 12 stickers

Next, Colton gave Mandy 2 more stickers than he gave his three friends in total. Since he gave his three friends 12 stickers, he gave Mandy:
12 stickers + 2 stickers = 14 stickers

Then, Colton gave Justin 10 less stickers than Mandy. Since Mandy received 14 stickers, Justin received:
14 stickers - 10 stickers = 4 stickers

Now, let's calculate the total number of stickers Colton gave away:
12 stickers (to the 3 friends) + 14 stickers (to Mandy) + 4 stickers (to Justin) = 30 stickers

Finally, to find out how many stickers Colton has left, we subtract the total number of stickers he gave away from the initial number of stickers he had:
72 stickers - 30 stickers = 42 stickers

So, Colton has <final_answer>42</final_answer> stickers left.

Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.

Next, a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are left for Alice to fold. There were 500 paper cranes left after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of them. So, the number of paper cranes left for Alice to fold is 500 - 100 = 400.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold <final_answer>400</final_answer> paper cranes.

First, Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.

Next, a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are left for Alice to fold. There were 500 paper cranes left after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of them. So, the number of paper cranes left for Alice to fold is 500 - 100 = 400.

Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has. We know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we can start by finding half of Bill's toys.

Half of Bill's toys is 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more toys than this amount, so we add 9 to 30:

30 + 9 = 39 toys.

This means Hash has 39 toys. To find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39):

60 + 39 = 99 toys.

So, the total number of toys the boys have is <final_answer>99</final_answer>.

Colton had 72 dolphin stickers. He gave 4 stickers each to 3 friends.  He also gave his friend Mandy 2 more than he gave his three friends total.   And he gave Justin 10 less than Mandy.  How many stickers does Colton have left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate how many stickers Colton gave to his three friends. He gave 4 stickers to each of the 3 friends, so the total number of stickers given to these friends is:
4 stickers/friend * 3 friends = 12 stickers

Next, Colton gave Mandy 2 more stickers than he gave his three friends in total. Since he gave his three friends 12 stickers, he gave Mandy:
12 stickers + 2 stickers = 14 stickers

Then, Colton gave Justin 10 less stickers than Mandy. Since Mandy received 14 stickers, Justin received:
14 stickers - 10 stickers = 4 stickers

Now, let's calculate the total number of stickers Colton gave away:
12 stickers (to the 3 friends) + 14 stickers (to Mandy) + 4 stickers (to Justin) = 30 stickers

Finally, to find out how many stickers Colton has left, we subtract the total number of stickers he gave away from the initial number of stickers he had:
72 stickers - 30 stickers = 42 stickers

So, Colton has <final_answer>42</final_answer> stickers left.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

First, Alice folds half of the 1000 paper cranes by herself. Half of 1000 is 1000 / 2 = 500. So, Alice folds 500 paper cranes.

Now, there are 1000 - 500 = 500 paper cranes left.

Next, a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. A fifth of 500 is 500 / 5 = 100. So, the friend folds 100 paper cranes.

Now, we need to find out how many paper cranes are left for Alice to fold. There were 500 paper cranes left after Alice folded her half, and the friend folded 100 of them. So, the number of paper cranes left for Alice to fold is 500 - 100 = 400.

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold <final_answer>400</final_answer> paper cranes.

Claire is scheduling her day. She has four hours to clean and two hours to cook, then divides the rest of her working day equally between crafting and tailoring. She then sleeps eight hours. If all of this takes place within one day, how many hours did Claire spend crafting?
Output:
To find out how many hours Claire spent crafting, we need to first determine the total number of hours in a day and then subtract the hours she spent on other activities.

1. There are 24 hours in a day.
2. Claire spends 4 hours cleaning and 2 hours cooking, which is a total of 4 + 2 = 6 hours.
3. She sleeps for 8 hours.
4. The total time spent on cleaning, cooking, and sleeping is 6 + 8 = 14 hours.
5. This leaves 24 - 14 = 10 hours for other activities.
6. Since she divides the rest of her day equally between crafting and tailoring, she spends half of the remaining 10 hours on crafting.
7. Half of 10 hours is 10 / 2 = 5 hours.

Input:
Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill has. If Bill has 60 toys, how many total toys do the boys have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many toys Hash has. We know that Bill has 60 toys. Since Hash has nine more than half as many toys as Bill, we can start by finding half of Bill's toys.

Half of Bill's toys is 60 / 2 = 30 toys.

Now, we know that Hash has 9 more toys than this amount, so we add 9 to 30:

30 + 9 = 39 toys.

This means Hash has 39 toys. To find the total number of toys the boys have, we add the number of toys Bill has (60) to the number of toys Hash has (39):

60 + 39 = 99 toys.

So, the total number of toys the boys have is <final_answer>99</final_answer>.

Input:
Colton had 72 dolphin stickers. He gave 4 stickers each to 3 friends.  He also gave his friend Mandy 2 more than he gave his three friends total.   And he gave Justin 10 less than Mandy.  How many stickers does Colton have left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, let's calculate how many stickers Colton gave to his three friends. He gave 4 stickers to each of the 3 friends, so the total number of stickers given to these friends is:
4 stickers/friend * 3 friends = 12 stickers

Next, Colton gave Mandy 2 more stickers than he gave his three friends in total. Since he gave his three friends 12 stickers, he gave Mandy:
12 stickers + 2 stickers = 14 stickers

Then, Colton gave Justin 10 less stickers than Mandy. Since Mandy received 14 stickers, Justin received:
14 stickers - 10 stickers = 4 stickers

Now, let's calculate the total number of stickers Colton gave away:
12 stickers (to the 3 friends) + 14 stickers (to Mandy) + 4 stickers (to Justin) = 30 stickers

Finally, to find out how many stickers Colton has left, we subtract the total number of stickers he gave away from the initial number of stickers he had:
72 stickers - 30 stickers = 42 stickers

So, Colton has <final_answer>42</final_answer> stickers left.

Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance.

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

Input:
Mark wants to build a pyramid of soda cases that's four levels tall. Each level of the pyramid has a square base where each side is one case longer than the level above it. The top level is just one case. How many cases of soda does Mark need?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of cases in each level of the pyramid and then add them up.

The top level has 1 case, since it's just one case.

The second level has a square base with 2 cases on each side, so it has 2 x 2 = 4 cases.

The third level has a square base with 3 cases on each side, so it has 3 x 3 = 9 cases.

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour

<final_answer> 448 </final_answer>

The fourth level has a square base with 4 cases on each side, so it has 4 x 4 = 16 cases.

Now, we add up the number of cases in each level: 1 + 4 + 9 + 16 = 30.

So, Mark needs 30 cases of soda to build his pyramid.

Input:
Two alien spacecraft on a sightseeing tour of Earth left New Orleans airport at 3:00 pm to travel the 448-mile distance to Dallas by air.  Traveling nonstop, the first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, while the second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later. Assuming both spacecraft traveled at constant speed, what was the difference in speed, in miles per hour, between the two spacecraft?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to find the speed of each spacecraft and then calculate the difference in their speeds.

The first spacecraft landed in Dallas at 3:30 pm, which means it took 30 minutes or 0.5 hours to cover the 448-mile distance. 

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the first spacecraft = 448 miles / 0.5 hours = 896 miles per hour

The second spacecraft landed in Dallas thirty minutes later than the first spacecraft, which means it landed at 4:00 pm. It took 1 hour to cover the 448-mile distance.

Speed = Distance / Time
Speed of the second spacecraft = 448 miles / 1 hour = 448 miles per hour

Now, we can calculate the difference in speed between the two spacecraft:

Difference in speed = Speed of the first spacecraft - Speed of the second spacecraft
= 896 miles per hour - 448 miles per hour
= 448 miles per hour
