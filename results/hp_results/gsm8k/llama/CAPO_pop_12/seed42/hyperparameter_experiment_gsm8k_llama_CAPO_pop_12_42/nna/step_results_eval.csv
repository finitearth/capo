A boy has 12 oranges. He gives one-third of this number to his brother, one-fourth of the remainder to his friend and keeps the rest for himself. How many does his friend get?
Output:
To find out how many oranges the boy's friend gets, we need to follow the steps in the problem.

First, the boy gives one-third of his 12 oranges to his brother. One-third of 12 is calculated as 12 / 3 = 4 oranges given to his brother.

After giving 4 oranges to his brother, the boy is left with 12 - 4 = 8 oranges.

Next, the boy gives one-fourth of the remainder (which is 8 oranges) to his friend. One-fourth of 8 is calculated as 8 / 4 = 2 oranges given to his friend.

Therefore, the boy's friend gets 2 oranges.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to first find out how many students were in the group initially and then subtract the number of students who left.

The teachers divided the group of students into 3 groups of 8. This means that the total number of students initially was 3 * 8 = 24.

Then, 2 students left early. To find out how many students remain, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial total: 24 - 2 = 22.

Input:
The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. James starts with 500 Legos.
2. He uses half of them to build a castle. To find out how many he used, we divide 500 by 2.
   500 / 2 = 250 Legos used.
3. This means he has 500 - 250 = 250 Legos left.
4. He puts all the leftover Legos back in the box except for 5 missing pieces.
   So, he puts 250 - 5 = 245 Legos back in the box.

Therefore, the number of Legos in the box at the end is <final_answer>245</final_answer>.

1. We know that there are 32 tables in total.
2. All tables except one have 2 fish in their centerpiece. This means 31 tables have 2 fish each.
3. To find the total number of fish in these 31 tables, we multiply the number of tables by the number of fish per table: 31 tables * 2 fish/table = 62 fish.
4. The remaining table has 3 fish.

Input:
Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of tabs remaining after each step.

1. Initially, Jose had 400 tabs open.
2. He closed 1/4 of the tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed, we calculate 1/4 of 400:
   1/4 * 400 = 100 tabs closed.
   So, he had 400 - 100 = 300 tabs remaining.

3. Then, he closed 2/5 of the remaining 300 tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 2/5 of 300:
   2/5 * 300 = 120 tabs closed.
   So, he had 300 - 120 = 180 tabs remaining.

4. Finally, he closed half of the remaining tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 1/2 of 180:
   1/2 * 180 = 90 tabs closed.
   So, he had 180 - 90 = 90 tabs remaining.

Therefore, after all these steps, Jose had 90 tabs remaining open.

Input:
Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters/minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

Input:
Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far and then subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to write, which is 500.

On the first day, Cyrus writes 25 pages.

On the second day, he writes twice the amount he did on the first day, which is 2 x 25 = 50 pages.

On the third day, he writes twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 x 50 = 100 pages.

On the fourth day, he writes 10 pages.

Now, let's add up the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far:
25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages

Since Cyrus needs to write a total of 500 pages, we subtract the number of pages he has already written from the total:
500 - 185 = 315 pages

Therefore, Cyrus needs to write <final_answer>315</final_answer> more pages to complete his book.

In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. If Nora is currently 10 years old, how old is Terry now?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Nora is currently 10 years old.
2. In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. Since Nora is currently 10 years old, 4 times her current age is 4 * 10 = 40.
3. This means that in 10 years, Terry will be 40 years old.
4. To find Terry's current age, we need to subtract 10 years from the age Terry will be in 10 years. So, Terry's current age is 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, <final_answer>30</final_answer> is Terry's current age.

Jane is sewing sequins onto her trapeze artist costume. She sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each, 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each, and 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. How many sequins does she add total?
Output:
To find the total number of sequins Jane adds, we need to calculate the number of sequins for each color and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of blue sequins:
6 rows * 8 sequins per row = 6 * 8 = 48 blue sequins

Next, let's calculate the number of purple sequins:
5 rows * 12 sequins per row = 5 * 12 = 60 purple sequins

Finally, let's calculate the number of green sequins:
9 rows * 6 sequins per row = 9 * 6 = 54 green sequins

Now, let's add up the total number of sequins:
48 blue sequins + 60 purple sequins + 54 green sequins = 162 sequins

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The neighborhood has 18 streets, and the association wants to plant a tree on every street. This means they will plant a total of 18 trees.

2. They want every other tree to be a fruit tree. This implies that half of the trees will be fruit trees, and the other half will be some other type of tree (not specified in the problem). Since there are 18 trees in total, half of them will be fruit trees. To find half of 18, we divide 18 by 2:
18 / 2 = 9

So, 9 trees will be fruit trees.

3. The association agreed to plant equal numbers of plum, pear, and apricot trees. Since there are 9 fruit trees in total, and they want to divide these equally among the three types of fruit trees, we divide 9 by 3:
9 / 3 = 3

This means they will plant 3 of each kind of fruit tree: plum, pear, and apricot.

3. Add the number of stamps bought to the number of stamps Bert had before the purchase.

Step 1: Bert bought 300 stamps.

Step 2: Before the purchase, Bert had only half the stamps he bought. Since he bought 300 stamps, he had 300 / 2 = 150 stamps before the purchase.

Step 3: To find the total number of stamps Bert has after the purchase, we add the stamps he bought to the stamps he already had: 300 (bought) + 150 (already had) = 450 stamps.

Input:
The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

The teachers divided the group of students into 3 groups of 8. This means that the total number of students initially was 3 * 8 = 24.

Then, 2 students left early. To find out how many students remain, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial total: 24 - 2 = 22.

Input:
The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

Input:
James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. James starts with 500 Legos.
2. He uses half of them to build a castle. To find out how many he used, we divide 500 by 2.
   500 / 2 = 250 Legos used.
3. This means he has 500 - 250 = 250 Legos left.
4. He puts all the leftover Legos back in the box except for 5 missing pieces.
   So, he puts 250 - 5 = 245 Legos back in the box.

Therefore, the number of Legos in the box at the end is <final_answer>245</final_answer>.

Input:
Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of tabs remaining after each step.

1. Initially, Jose had 400 tabs open.
2. He closed 1/4 of the tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed, we calculate 1/4 of 400:
   1/4 * 400 = 100 tabs closed.
   So, he had 400 - 100 = 300 tabs remaining.

3. Then, he closed 2/5 of the remaining 300 tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 2/5 of 300:
   2/5 * 300 = 120 tabs closed.
   So, he had 300 - 120 = 180 tabs remaining.

4. Finally, he closed half of the remaining tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 1/2 of 180:
   1/2 * 180 = 90 tabs closed.
   So, he had 180 - 90 = 90 tabs remaining.

Therefore, after all these steps, Jose had 90 tabs remaining open.

Input:
Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters/minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

Input:
Cyrus has been contracted to write a 500 page book.  On his first day, he writes 25 pages and twice that amount on the second day.  On the third day he is able to write twice the amount that he did on the second day.  On the fourth day, he gets writer's block and is only able to write 10 pages.  How many more pages does he need to write?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far and then subtract that from the total number of pages he needs to write, which is 500.

On the first day, Cyrus writes 25 pages.

On the second day, he writes twice the amount he did on the first day, which is 2 x 25 = 50 pages.

On the third day, he writes twice the amount he did on the second day, which is 2 x 50 = 100 pages.

On the fourth day, he writes 10 pages.

Now, let's add up the total number of pages Cyrus has written so far:
25 + 50 + 100 + 10 = 185 pages

Since Cyrus needs to write a total of 500 pages, we subtract the number of pages he has already written from the total:
500 - 185 = 315 pages

Therefore, Cyrus needs to write <final_answer>315</final_answer> more pages to complete his book.

In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. If Nora is currently 10 years old, how old is Terry now?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that Nora is currently 10 years old.
2. In 10 years, Terry will be 4 times the age that Nora is currently. Since Nora is currently 10 years old, 4 times her current age is 4 * 10 = 40.
3. This means that in 10 years, Terry will be 40 years old.
4. To find Terry's current age, we need to subtract 10 years from the age Terry will be in 10 years. So, Terry's current age is 40 - 10 = 30.

Therefore, <final_answer>30</final_answer> is Terry's current age.

Jane is sewing sequins onto her trapeze artist costume. She sews 6 rows of 8 blue sequins each, 5 rows of 12 purple sequins each, and 9 rows of 6 green sequins each. How many sequins does she add total?
Output:
To find the total number of sequins Jane adds, we need to calculate the number of sequins for each color and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the number of blue sequins:
6 rows * 8 sequins per row = 6 * 8 = 48 blue sequins

Next, let's calculate the number of purple sequins:
5 rows * 12 sequins per row = 5 * 12 = 60 purple sequins

Finally, let's calculate the number of green sequins:
9 rows * 6 sequins per row = 9 * 6 = 54 green sequins

Now, let's add up the total number of sequins:
48 blue sequins + 60 purple sequins + 54 green sequins = 162 sequins

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. The neighborhood has 18 streets, and the association wants to plant a tree on every street. This means they will plant a total of 18 trees.

2. They want every other tree to be a fruit tree. This implies that half of the trees will be fruit trees, and the other half will be some other type of tree (not specified in the problem). Since there are 18 trees in total, half of them will be fruit trees. To find half of 18, we divide 18 by 2:
18 / 2 = 9

So, 9 trees will be fruit trees.

3. The association agreed to plant equal numbers of plum, pear, and apricot trees. Since there are 9 fruit trees in total, and they want to divide these equally among the three types of fruit trees, we divide 9 by 3:
9 / 3 = 3

This means they will plant 3 of each kind of fruit tree: plum, pear, and apricot.

3. Add the number of stamps bought to the number of stamps Bert had before the purchase.

Step 1: Bert bought 300 stamps.

Step 2: Before the purchase, Bert had only half the stamps he bought. Since he bought 300 stamps, he had 300 / 2 = 150 stamps before the purchase.

Step 3: To find the total number of stamps Bert has after the purchase, we add the stamps he bought to the stamps he already had: 300 (bought) + 150 (already had) = 450 stamps.

The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

Then, 2 students left early. To find out how many students remain, we subtract the number of students who left from the initial total: 24 - 2 = 22.

Input:
James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. James starts with 500 Legos.
2. He uses half of them to build a castle. To find out how many he used, we divide 500 by 2.
   500 / 2 = 250 Legos used.
3. This means he has 500 - 250 = 250 Legos left.
4. He puts all the leftover Legos back in the box except for 5 missing pieces.
   So, he puts 250 - 5 = 245 Legos back in the box.

Therefore, the number of Legos in the box at the end is <final_answer>245</final_answer>.

The centerpieces at Glenda’s wedding reception include a fishbowl containing 2 fish, except for one table that has 3 fish. There are 32 tables. How many fish are there?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that there are 32 tables in total at the wedding reception.
2. All tables except one have a fishbowl with 2 fish. This means that 31 tables have 2 fish each.
3. The number of fish in these 31 tables can be calculated by multiplying the number of tables by the number of fish per table: 31 tables * 2 fish/table = 62 fish.
4. We also know that one table has 3 fish instead of 2.
5. To find the total number of fish, we add the number of fish from the 31 tables with 2 fish each to the number of fish in the table with 3 fish: 62 fish + 3 fish = 65 fish.

Therefore, the total number of fish is calculated by adding the fish from all tables.

Input:
Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of tabs remaining after each step.

1. Initially, Jose had 400 tabs open.
2. He closed 1/4 of the tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed, we calculate 1/4 of 400:
   1/4 * 400 = 100 tabs closed.
   So, he had 400 - 100 = 300 tabs remaining.

3. Then, he closed 2/5 of the remaining 300 tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 2/5 of 300:
   2/5 * 300 = 120 tabs closed.
   So, he had 300 - 120 = 180 tabs remaining.

4. Finally, he closed half of the remaining tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 1/2 of 180:
   1/2 * 180 = 90 tabs closed.
   So, he had 180 - 90 = 90 tabs remaining.

Therefore, after all these steps, Jose had 90 tabs remaining open.

Input:
Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters/minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

3. To find the total number of fish in these 31 tables, we multiply the number of tables by the number of fish per table: 31 tables * 2 fish/table = 62 fish.
4. The remaining table has 3 fish.
5. To find the total number of fish, we add the fish from the 31 tables with 2 fish each to the fish from the table with 3 fish: 62 fish + 3 fish = 65 fish.

Input:
Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of tabs remaining after each step.

1. Initially, Jose had 400 tabs open.
2. He closed 1/4 of the tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed, we calculate 1/4 of 400:
   1/4 * 400 = 100 tabs closed.
   So, he had 400 - 100 = 300 tabs remaining.

3. Then, he closed 2/5 of the remaining 300 tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 2/5 of 300:
   2/5 * 300 = 120 tabs closed.
   So, he had 300 - 120 = 180 tabs remaining.

4. Finally, he closed half of the remaining tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 1/2 of 180:
   1/2 * 180 = 90 tabs closed.
   So, he had 180 - 90 = 90 tabs remaining.

Therefore, after all these steps, Jose had 90 tabs remaining open.

Input:
The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

Input:
Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters/minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Input:
Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. James starts with 500 Legos.
2. He uses half of them to build a castle. To find out how many he used, we divide 500 by 2.
   500 / 2 = 250 Legos used.
3. This means he has 500 - 250 = 250 Legos left.
4. He puts all the leftover Legos back in the box except for 5 missing pieces.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters/minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Input:
Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

Input:
Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of tabs remaining after each step.

1. Initially, Jose had 400 tabs open.
2. He closed 1/4 of the tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed, we calculate 1/4 of 400:
   1/4 * 400 = 100 tabs closed.
   So, he had 400 - 100 = 300 tabs remaining.

3. Then, he closed 2/5 of the remaining 300 tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 2/5 of 300:
   2/5 * 300 = 120 tabs closed.
   So, he had 300 - 120 = 180 tabs remaining.

4. Finally, he closed half of the remaining tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 1/2 of 180:
   1/2 * 180 = 90 tabs closed.
   So, he had 180 - 90 = 90 tabs remaining.

Therefore, after all these steps, Jose had 90 tabs remaining open.

A boy has 12 oranges. He gives one-third of this number to his brother, one-fourth of the remainder to his friend and keeps the rest for himself. How many does his friend get?
Output:
To find out how many oranges the boy's friend gets, we need to follow the steps in the problem.

First, the boy gives one-third of his 12 oranges to his brother. One-third of 12 is calculated as 12 / 3 = 4 oranges given to his brother.

After giving 4 oranges to his brother, the boy is left with 12 - 4 = 8 oranges.

Next, the boy gives one-fourth of the remainder (which is 8 oranges) to his friend. One-fourth of 8 is calculated as 8 / 4 = 2 oranges given to his friend.

Therefore, the boy's friend gets 2 oranges.

The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. James starts with 500 Legos.
2. He uses half of them to build a castle. To find out how many he used, we divide 500 by 2.
   500 / 2 = 250 Legos used.
3. This means he has 500 - 250 = 250 Legos left.
4. He puts all the leftover Legos back in the box except for 5 missing pieces.

Bob can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes.  How many oysters can he shuck in 2 hours?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into multiple logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many oysters Bob can shuck per minute. We know that he can shuck 10 oysters in 5 minutes. To find out how many oysters he can shuck per minute, we divide the total number of oysters (10) by the number of minutes (5). 

10 oysters / 5 minutes = 2 oysters per minute

Now that we know Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, we need to find out how many minutes are in 2 hours. There are 60 minutes in 1 hour, so there are 60 * 2 = 120 minutes in 2 hours.

Since Bob can shuck 2 oysters per minute, and there are 120 minutes in 2 hours, we multiply the number of oysters he can shuck per minute by the total number of minutes in 2 hours.

2 oysters/minute * 120 minutes = 240 oysters

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow a series of logical steps.

First, we need to determine how many yards of ribbon will be used for the 6 gifts. Since each gift requires 2 yards of ribbon, we multiply the number of gifts by the amount of ribbon each gift needs: 6 gifts * 2 yards/gift = 12 yards.

Next, we need to subtract the amount of ribbon used from the total amount of ribbon Josh has. Josh started with 18 yards of ribbon, and 12 yards will be used for the gifts. So, we subtract 12 yards from 18 yards to find out how many yards will be left: 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Therefore, after using the ribbon for the 6 gifts, Josh will have 6 yards of ribbon left.

A boy has 12 oranges. He gives one-third of this number to his brother, one-fourth of the remainder to his friend and keeps the rest for himself. How many does his friend get?
Output:
To find out how many oranges the boy's friend gets, we need to follow the steps in the problem.

First, the boy gives one-third of his 12 oranges to his brother. One-third of 12 is calculated as 12 / 3 = 4 oranges given to his brother.

After giving 4 oranges to his brother, the boy is left with 12 - 4 = 8 oranges.

Next, the boy gives one-fourth of the remainder (which is 8 oranges) to his friend. One-fourth of 8 is calculated as 8 / 4 = 2 oranges given to his friend.

Therefore, the boy's friend gets 2 oranges.

Input:
The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. James starts with 500 Legos.
2. He uses half of them to build a castle. To find out how many he used, we divide 500 by 2.
   500 / 2 = 250 Legos used.
3. This means he has 500 - 250 = 250 Legos left.
4. He puts all the leftover Legos back in the box except for 5 missing pieces.
   So, he puts 250 - 5 = 245 Legos back in the box.

Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that there are 32 tables in total at the wedding reception.
2. All tables except one have a fishbowl with 2 fish. This means that 31 tables have 2 fish each.

Input:
Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of tabs remaining after each step.

1. Initially, Jose had 400 tabs open.
2. He closed 1/4 of the tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed, we calculate 1/4 of 400:
   1/4 * 400 = 100 tabs closed.
   So, he had 400 - 100 = 300 tabs remaining.

3. Then, he closed 2/5 of the remaining 300 tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 2/5 of 300:
   2/5 * 300 = 120 tabs closed.
   So, he had 300 - 120 = 180 tabs remaining.

4. Finally, he closed half of the remaining tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 1/2 of 180:
   1/2 * 180 = 90 tabs closed.
   So, he had 180 - 90 = 90 tabs remaining.

Therefore, after all these steps, Jose had 90 tabs remaining open.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

A boy has 12 oranges. He gives one-third of this number to his brother, one-fourth of the remainder to his friend and keeps the rest for himself. How many does his friend get?
Output:
To find out how many oranges the boy's friend gets, we need to follow the steps in the problem.

First, the boy gives one-third of his 12 oranges to his brother. One-third of 12 is calculated as 12 / 3 = 4 oranges given to his brother.

After giving 4 oranges to his brother, the boy is left with 12 - 4 = 8 oranges.

Next, the boy gives one-fourth of the remainder (which is 8 oranges) to his friend. One-fourth of 8 is calculated as 8 / 4 = 2 oranges given to his friend.

Therefore, the boy's friend gets 2 oranges.

James dumps his whole collection of 500 Legos on the floor and starts building a castle out of them.  He uses half the pieces before finishing and is told to put the rest away.  He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. James starts with 500 Legos.
2. He uses half of them to build a castle. To find out how many he used, we divide 500 by 2.
   500 / 2 = 250 Legos used.
3. This means he has 500 - 250 = 250 Legos left.
4. He puts all the leftover Legos back in the box except for 5 missing pieces.
   So, he puts 250 - 5 = 245 Legos back in the box.

Input:
The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

Input:
Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of tabs remaining after each step.

1. Initially, Jose had 400 tabs open.
2. He closed 1/4 of the tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed, we calculate 1/4 of 400:
   1/4 * 400 = 100 tabs closed.
   So, he had 400 - 100 = 300 tabs remaining.

3. Then, he closed 2/5 of the remaining 300 tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 2/5 of 300:
   2/5 * 300 = 120 tabs closed.
   So, he had 300 - 120 = 180 tabs remaining.

4. Finally, he closed half of the remaining tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 1/2 of 180:
   1/2 * 180 = 90 tabs closed.
   So, he had 180 - 90 = 90 tabs remaining.

Therefore, after all these steps, Jose had 90 tabs remaining open.

The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

Input:
The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

Input:
Jose had 400 tabs opened up in his windows browser. After about one hour of browsing, he closed 1/4 of the tabs to allows easy browsing. He read some news from different pages, then closed 2/5 of the remaining tabs. If he closed half of the remaining tabs after further analyzing some pages, how many windows tabs did he have remaining open?
Output:
To solve this problem, we will break it down into steps and calculate the number of tabs remaining after each step.

1. Initially, Jose had 400 tabs open.
2. He closed 1/4 of the tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed, we calculate 1/4 of 400:
   1/4 * 400 = 100 tabs closed.
   So, he had 400 - 100 = 300 tabs remaining.

3. Then, he closed 2/5 of the remaining 300 tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 2/5 of 300:
   2/5 * 300 = 120 tabs closed.
   So, he had 300 - 120 = 180 tabs remaining.

4. Finally, he closed half of the remaining tabs. To find out how many tabs he closed this time, we calculate 1/2 of 180:
   1/2 * 180 = 90 tabs closed.
   So, he had 180 - 90 = 90 tabs remaining.

Therefore, after all these steps, Jose had 90 tabs remaining open.

Input:
The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

Input:
The centerpieces at Glenda’s wedding reception include a fishbowl containing 2 fish, except for one table that has 3 fish. There are 32 tables. How many fish are there?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step.

1. We know that there are 32 tables in total.
2. All tables except one have 2 fish in their centerpiece. This means 31 tables have 2 fish each.
3. To find the total number of fish in these 31 tables, we multiply the number of tables by the number of fish per table: 31 tables * 2 fish/table = 62 fish.
4. The remaining table has 3 fish.
5. To find the total number of fish, we add the fish from the 31 tables with 2 fish each to the fish from the table with 3 fish: 62 fish + 3 fish = 65 fish.

Therefore, <final_answer>65</final_answer> fish are at Glenda's wedding reception.

A boy has 12 oranges. He gives one-third of this number to his brother, one-fourth of the remainder to his friend and keeps the rest for himself. How many does his friend get?
Output:
To find out how many oranges the boy's friend gets, we need to follow the steps in the problem.

First, the boy gives one-third of his 12 oranges to his brother. One-third of 12 is calculated as 12 / 3 = 4 oranges given to his brother.

After giving 4 oranges to his brother, the boy is left with 12 - 4 = 8 oranges.

Next, the boy gives one-fourth of the remainder (which is 8 oranges) to his friend. One-fourth of 8 is calculated as 8 / 4 = 2 oranges given to his friend.

Therefore, the boy's friend gets 2 oranges.

Input:
The ratio representing the age of Halima, Beckham, and Michelle is 4:3:7, respectively. If the total age for the three siblings is 126, calculate the age difference between Halima and Beckham.
Output:
To solve this problem, we first need to find the total parts in the ratio and then determine the value of each part. The ratio given is 4:3:7, so the total parts are 4 + 3 + 7 = 14 parts.

We know the total age of the siblings is 126 years. To find the value of each part, we divide the total age by the total number of parts in the ratio:
126 years / 14 parts = 9 years per part.

Now, we can find the age of each sibling by multiplying their respective ratio by the value of each part:
- Halima's age = 4 parts * 9 years/part = 36 years.
- Beckham's age = 3 parts * 9 years/part = 27 years.
- Michelle's age = 7 parts * 9 years/part = 63 years.

To find the age difference between Halima and Beckham, we subtract Beckham's age from Halima's age:
Age difference = Halima's age - Beckham's age = 36 years - 27 years = 9 years.

He puts all of the leftover pieces back in the box they came from, except for 5 missing pieces that he can't find.  How many Legos are in the box at the end?
Output:
To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps.

1. James starts with 500 Legos.
2. He uses half of them to build a castle. To find out how many he used, we divide 500 by 2.
   500 / 2 = 250 Legos used.
3. This means he has 500 - 250 = 250 Legos left.
4. He puts all the leftover Legos back in the box except for 5 missing pieces.
   So, he puts 250 - 5 = 245 Legos back in the box.
