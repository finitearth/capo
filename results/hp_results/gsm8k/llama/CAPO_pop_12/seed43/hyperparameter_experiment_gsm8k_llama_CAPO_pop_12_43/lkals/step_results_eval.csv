Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randy’s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events step by step:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift, so we add these to the initial amount: 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. Then, his mother gave him 15 biscuits, so we add these to the total: 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Finally, Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so we subtract these from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder, but she knew she would need more for her next class. Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder out and gave them to her. How many pages does Lana have in her binder after adding Duane’s?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pages Duane gave to Lana. Since Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder, we need to divide 42 by 2.
42 / 2 = 21

So, Duane gave 21 pages to Lana.

2. Now, we need to add the pages Duane gave to Lana to the pages Lana already had in her binder. Lana had 8 pages initially, and she received 21 pages from Duane.
8 + 21 = 29

Therefore, Lana now has 29 pages in her binder.

Input:
Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Kent has 40 legos. Since Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent, we can calculate the number of legos Bruce has by adding 20 to Kent's total:

40 (Kent's legos) + 20 = 60

So, Bruce has 60 legos.

Next, we know that Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce. To find 20% of Bruce's legos, we can multiply Bruce's total by 0.20:

60 (Bruce's legos) * 0.20 = 12

This means that Simon has 12 more legos than Bruce. To find Simon's total, we can add 12 to Bruce's total:

60 (Bruce's legos) + 12 = 72

Therefore, Simon has <final_answer>72</final_answer> legos.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Output:
To find the total number of valid documents, we first need to calculate the number of invalid documents, which are 40% of the total papers. 

First, calculate 40% of 400:
40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160

So, 160 papers are invalid. To find the number of valid papers, subtract the number of invalid papers from the total number of papers:
400 - 160 = 240

Therefore, the total number of valid documents is 240.

Input:
A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Cameron is printing her thesis in the school library and has 400 A4 pieces of paper. If 40% of the papers did not print out up to her desired quality and she separated them as invalid, calculate the total number of valid documents.
Output:
To find the total number of valid documents, we first need to calculate the number of invalid documents, which are 40% of the total papers. 

First, calculate 40% of 400:
40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160

So, 160 papers are invalid. To find the number of valid papers, subtract the number of invalid papers from the total number of papers:
400 - 160 = 240

Therefore, the total number of valid documents is 240.

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift, so we add these to the initial amount: 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. Then, his mother gave him 15 biscuits, so we add these to the total: 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Finally, Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so we subtract these from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder, but she knew she would need more for her next class. Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder out and gave them to her. How many pages does Lana have in her binder after adding Duane’s?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pages Duane gave to Lana. Since Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder, we need to divide 42 by 2.
42 / 2 = 21

So, Duane gave 21 pages to Lana.

2. Now, we need to add the pages Duane gave to Lana to the pages Lana already had in her binder. Lana had 8 pages initially, and she received 21 pages from Duane.
8 + 21 = 29

Therefore, Lana now has 29 pages in her binder.

Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Kent has 40 legos. Since Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent, we can calculate the number of legos Bruce has by adding 20 to Kent's total:

40 (Kent's legos) + 20 = 60

So, Bruce has 60 legos.

Next, we know that Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce. To find 20% of Bruce's legos, we can multiply Bruce's total by 0.20:

60 (Bruce's legos) * 0.20 = 12

This means that Simon has 12 more legos than Bruce. To find Simon's total, we can add 12 to Bruce's total:

60 (Bruce's legos) + 12 = 72

Therefore, Simon has <final_answer>72</final_answer> legos.

Cameron is printing her thesis in the school library and has 400 A4 pieces of paper. If 40% of the papers did not print out up to her desired quality and she separated them as invalid, calculate the total number of valid documents.
Output:
To find the total number of valid documents, we first need to calculate the number of invalid documents, which are 40% of the total papers. 

First, calculate 40% of 400:
40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160

So, 160 papers are invalid. To find the number of valid papers, subtract the number of invalid papers from the total number of papers:
400 - 160 = 240

Therefore, the total number of valid documents is 240.

Input:
Tina has 12 pink pens. She has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. How many pens does Tina have in total?
Output:
To find the total number of pens Tina has, we need to calculate the number of green pens and blue pens she has, and then add them to the number of pink pens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of green pens.
Tina has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. Since she has 12 pink pens, the number of green pens is:
12 (pink pens) - 9 = 3 green pens.

Step 2: Calculate the number of blue pens.
Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. Since she has 3 green pens, the number of blue pens is:
3 (green pens) + 3 = 6 blue pens.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pens.
Now, we add the number of pink pens, green pens, and blue pens:
12 (pink pens) + 3 (green pens) + 6 (blue pens) = 21 pens.

Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events step by step:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift, so we add these to the initial amount: 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. Then, his mother gave him 15 biscuits, so we add these to the total: 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Finally, Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so we subtract these from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder, but she knew she would need more for her next class. Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder out and gave them to her. How many pages does Lana have in her binder after adding Duane’s?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pages Duane gave to Lana. Since Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder, we need to divide 42 by 2.
42 / 2 = 21

So, Duane gave 21 pages to Lana.

2. Now, we need to add the pages Duane gave to Lana to the pages Lana already had in her binder. Lana had 8 pages initially, and she received 21 pages from Duane.
8 + 21 = 29

Therefore, Lana now has 29 pages in her binder.

Input:
Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Kent has 40 legos. Since Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent, we can calculate the number of legos Bruce has by adding 20 to Kent's total:

40 (Kent's legos) + 20 = 60

So, Bruce has 60 legos.

Next, we know that Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce. To find 20% of Bruce's legos, we can multiply Bruce's total by 0.20:

60 (Bruce's legos) * 0.20 = 12

This means that Simon has 12 more legos than Bruce. To find Simon's total, we can add 12 to Bruce's total:

60 (Bruce's legos) + 12 = 72

Therefore, Simon has <final_answer>72</final_answer> legos.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events step by step:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift, so we add these to the initial amount: 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. Then, his mother gave him 15 biscuits, so we add these to the total: 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Finally, Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so we subtract these from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder, but she knew she would need more for her next class. Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder out and gave them to her. How many pages does Lana have in her binder after adding Duane’s?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pages Duane gave to Lana. Since Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder, we need to divide 42 by 2.
42 / 2 = 21

So, Duane gave 21 pages to Lana.

2. Now, we need to add the pages Duane gave to Lana to the pages Lana already had in her binder. Lana had 8 pages initially, and she received 21 pages from Duane.
8 + 21 = 29

Therefore, Lana now has 29 pages in her binder.

Input:
Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Kent has 40 legos. Since Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent, we can calculate the number of legos Bruce has by adding 20 to Kent's total:

40 (Kent's legos) + 20 = 60

So, Bruce has 60 legos.

Next, we know that Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce. To find 20% of Bruce's legos, we can multiply Bruce's total by 0.20:

60 (Bruce's legos) * 0.20 = 12

This means that Simon has 12 more legos than Bruce. To find Simon's total, we can add 12 to Bruce's total:

60 (Bruce's legos) + 12 = 72

Therefore, Simon has <final_answer>72</final_answer> legos.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

To find the total number of valid documents, we first need to calculate the number of invalid documents, which are 40% of the total papers. 

First, calculate 40% of 400:
40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160

So, 160 papers are invalid. To find the number of valid papers, subtract the number of invalid papers from the total number of papers:

To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.

Tina has 12 pink pens. She has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. How many pens does Tina have in total?
Output:
To find the total number of pens Tina has, we need to calculate the number of green pens and blue pens she has, and then add them to the number of pink pens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of green pens.
Tina has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. Since she has 12 pink pens, the number of green pens is:
12 (pink pens) - 9 = 3 green pens.

Step 2: Calculate the number of blue pens.
Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. Since she has 3 green pens, the number of blue pens is:

Input:
A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Cameron is printing her thesis in the school library and has 400 A4 pieces of paper. If 40% of the papers did not print out up to her desired quality and she separated them as invalid, calculate the total number of valid documents.
Output:
To find the total number of valid documents, we first need to calculate the number of invalid documents, which are 40% of the total papers. 

First, calculate 40% of 400:
40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160

So, 160 papers are invalid. To find the number of valid papers, subtract the number of invalid papers from the total number of papers:
400 - 160 = 240

Therefore, the total number of valid documents is 240.

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

Input:
Tina has 12 pink pens. She has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. How many pens does Tina have in total?
Output:
To find the total number of pens Tina has, we need to calculate the number of green pens and blue pens she has, and then add them to the number of pink pens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of green pens.
Tina has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. Since she has 12 pink pens, the number of green pens is:
12 (pink pens) - 9 = 3 green pens.

Step 2: Calculate the number of blue pens.
Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. Since she has 3 green pens, the number of blue pens is:
3 (green pens) + 3 = 6 blue pens.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pens.
Now, we add the number of pink pens, green pens, and blue pens:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pages Duane gave to Lana. Since Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder, we need to divide 42 by 2.

So, Duane gave 21 pages to Lana.

2. Now, we need to add the pages Duane gave to Lana to the pages Lana already had in her binder. Lana had 8 pages initially, and she received 21 pages from Duane.
8 + 21 = 29

Therefore, Lana now has 29 pages in her binder.

Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Kent has 40 legos. Since Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent, we can calculate the number of legos Bruce has by adding 20 to Kent's total:

40 (Kent's legos) + 20 = 60

So, Bruce has 60 legos.

Next, we know that Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce. To find 20% of Bruce's legos, we can multiply Bruce's total by 0.20:

60 (Bruce's legos) * 0.20 = 12

This means that Simon has 12 more legos than Bruce. To find Simon's total, we can add 12 to Bruce's total:

60 (Bruce's legos) + 12 = 72

Therefore, Simon has <final_answer>72</final_answer> legos.

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

Input:
A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Input:
Cameron is printing her thesis in the school library and has 400 A4 pieces of paper. If 40% of the papers did not print out up to her desired quality and she separated them as invalid, calculate the total number of valid documents.
Output:
To find the total number of valid documents, we first need to calculate the number of invalid documents, which are 40% of the total papers. 

First, calculate 40% of 400:
40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160

So, 160 papers are invalid. To find the number of valid papers, subtract the number of invalid papers from the total number of papers:
400 - 160 = 240

Therefore, the total number of valid documents is 240.

Input:
Tina has 12 pink pens. She has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. How many pens does Tina have in total?
Output:
To find the total number of pens Tina has, we need to calculate the number of green pens and blue pens she has, and then add them to the number of pink pens.

Step 1: Calculate the number of green pens.
Tina has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. Since she has 12 pink pens, the number of green pens is:
12 (pink pens) - 9 = 3 green pens.

Step 2: Calculate the number of blue pens.
Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. Since she has 3 green pens, the number of blue pens is:
3 (green pens) + 3 = 6 blue pens.

Step 3: Calculate the total number of pens.
Now, we add the number of pink pens, green pens, and blue pens:
12 (pink pens) + 3 (green pens) + 6 (blue pens) = 21 pens.

Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder, but she knew she would need more for her next class. Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder out and gave them to her. How many pages does Lana have in her binder after adding Duane’s?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pages Duane gave to Lana. Since Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder, we need to divide 42 by 2.
42 / 2 = 21

So, Duane gave 21 pages to Lana.

2. Now, we need to add the pages Duane gave to Lana to the pages Lana already had in her binder. Lana had 8 pages initially, and she received 21 pages from Duane.
8 + 21 = 29

Therefore, Lana now has 29 pages in her binder.

Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Kent has 40 legos. Since Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent, we can calculate the number of legos Bruce has by adding 20 to Kent's total:

40 (Kent's legos) + 20 = 60

So, Bruce has 60 legos.

Next, we know that Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce. To find 20% of Bruce's legos, we can multiply Bruce's total by 0.20:

60 (Bruce's legos) * 0.20 = 12

This means that Simon has 12 more legos than Bruce. To find Simon's total, we can add 12 to Bruce's total:

60 (Bruce's legos) + 12 = 72

Therefore, Simon has <final_answer>72</final_answer> legos.

Leo has to write a 400-word story for his literature class. 10 words fit on each line of his notebook and 20 lines fit on each page. Lucas has filled one and a half pages. How many words does he have left to write?
Output:
To find out how many words Leo has left to write, we first need to determine how many words he has already written. 

1. First, calculate the number of lines per page: 20 lines per page.
2. Since Lucas has filled one and a half pages, we need to find out how many lines that is: 1.5 pages * 20 lines/page = 30 lines.
3. Next, calculate the total number of words Lucas has written: 30 lines * 10 words/line = 300 words.
4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder, but she knew she would need more for her next class. Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder out and gave them to her. How many pages does Lana have in her binder after adding Duane’s?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pages Duane gave to Lana. Since Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder, we need to divide 42 by 2.
42 / 2 = 21

So, Duane gave 21 pages to Lana.

2. Now, we need to add the pages Duane gave to Lana to the pages Lana already had in her binder. Lana had 8 pages initially, and she received 21 pages from Duane.
8 + 21 = 29

Therefore, Lana now has 29 pages in her binder.

Input:
Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Kent has 40 legos. Since Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent, we can calculate the number of legos Bruce has by adding 20 to Kent's total:

40 (Kent's legos) + 20 = 60

So, Bruce has 60 legos.

Next, we know that Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce. To find 20% of Bruce's legos, we can multiply Bruce's total by 0.20:

60 (Bruce's legos) * 0.20 = 12

This means that Simon has 12 more legos than Bruce. To find Simon's total, we can add 12 to Bruce's total:

60 (Bruce's legos) + 12 = 72

Therefore, Simon has <final_answer>72</final_answer> legos.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

To find the total number of valid documents, we first need to calculate the number of invalid documents, which are 40% of the total papers. 

First, calculate 40% of 400:

So, 160 papers are invalid. To find the number of valid papers, subtract the number of invalid papers from the total number of papers:

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randy’s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events step by step:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift, so we add these to the initial amount: 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. Then, his mother gave him 15 biscuits, so we add these to the total: 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Finally, Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so we subtract these from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder, but she knew she would need more for her next class. Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder out and gave them to her. How many pages does Lana have in her binder after adding Duane’s?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pages Duane gave to Lana. Since Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder, we need to divide 42 by 2.
42 / 2 = 21

So, Duane gave 21 pages to Lana.

2. Now, we need to add the pages Duane gave to Lana to the pages Lana already had in her binder. Lana had 8 pages initially, and she received 21 pages from Duane.
8 + 21 = 29

Therefore, Lana now has 29 pages in her binder.

Input:
Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Kent has 40 legos. Since Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent, we can calculate the number of legos Bruce has by adding 20 to Kent's total:

40 (Kent's legos) + 20 = 60

So, Bruce has 60 legos.

Next, we know that Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce. To find 20% of Bruce's legos, we can multiply Bruce's total by 0.20:

60 (Bruce's legos) * 0.20 = 12

This means that Simon has 12 more legos than Bruce. To find Simon's total, we can add 12 to Bruce's total:

60 (Bruce's legos) + 12 = 72

Therefore, Simon has <final_answer>72</final_answer> legos.

A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Output:
To find the total number of valid documents, we first need to calculate the number of invalid documents, which are 40% of the total papers. 

First, calculate 40% of 400:
40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160

So, 160 papers are invalid. To find the number of valid papers, subtract the number of invalid papers from the total number of papers:
400 - 160 = 240

Therefore, the total number of valid documents is 240.

Input:
A cat has nine lives.  A dog has 3 less lives than a cat.  A mouse has 7 more lives than a dog.  How many lives does a mouse have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Output:
To find the total number of valid documents, we first need to calculate the number of invalid documents, which are 40% of the total papers. 

First, calculate 40% of 400:
40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160

So, 160 papers are invalid. To find the number of valid papers, subtract the number of invalid papers from the total number of papers:
400 - 160 = 240

Therefore, the total number of valid documents is 240.

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pages Duane gave to Lana. Since Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder, we need to divide 42 by 2.

So, Duane gave 21 pages to Lana.

2. Now, we need to add the pages Duane gave to Lana to the pages Lana already had in her binder. Lana had 8 pages initially, and she received 21 pages from Duane.
8 + 21 = 29

Therefore, Lana now has 29 pages in her binder.

Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?
Output:

40 (Kent's legos) + 20 = 60

So, Bruce has 60 legos.

Next, we know that Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce. To find 20% of Bruce's legos, we can multiply Bruce's total by 0.20:

60 (Bruce's legos) * 0.20 = 12

This means that Simon has 12 more legos than Bruce. To find Simon's total, we can add 12 to Bruce's total:

60 (Bruce's legos) + 12 = 72

Therefore, Simon has <final_answer>72</final_answer> legos.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:

Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder, but she knew she would need more for her next class. Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder out and gave them to her. How many pages does Lana have in her binder after adding Duane’s?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pages Duane gave to Lana. Since Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder, we need to divide 42 by 2.
42 / 2 = 21

So, Duane gave 21 pages to Lana.

2. Now, we need to add the pages Duane gave to Lana to the pages Lana already had in her binder. Lana had 8 pages initially, and she received 21 pages from Duane.
8 + 21 = 29

Therefore, Lana now has 29 pages in her binder.

Input:
Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Kent has 40 legos. Since Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent, we can calculate the number of legos Bruce has by adding 20 to Kent's total:

40 (Kent's legos) + 20 = 60

So, Bruce has 60 legos.

Next, we know that Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce. To find 20% of Bruce's legos, we can multiply Bruce's total by 0.20:

60 (Bruce's legos) * 0.20 = 12

This means that Simon has 12 more legos than Bruce. To find Simon's total, we can add 12 to Bruce's total:

60 (Bruce's legos) + 12 = 72

Therefore, Simon has <final_answer>72</final_answer> legos.

Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step.

First, we know that a cat has 9 lives.

Next, we're told that a dog has 3 less lives than a cat. So, to find out how many lives a dog has, we subtract 3 from the number of lives a cat has:
9 (cat's lives) - 3 = 6

Now we know that a dog has 6 lives.

Then, we're told that a mouse has 7 more lives than a dog. To find out how many lives a mouse has, we add 7 to the number of lives a dog has:
6 (dog's lives) + 7 = 13

Therefore, a mouse has 13 lives.

Output:
To find the total number of valid documents, we first need to calculate the number of invalid documents, which are 40% of the total papers. 

First, calculate 40% of 400:
40% of 400 = 0.4 * 400 = 160

So, 160 papers are invalid. To find the number of valid papers, subtract the number of invalid papers from the total number of papers:
400 - 160 = 240

Therefore, the total number of valid documents is 240.

4. Now, subtract the number of words Lucas has written from the total number of words he needs to write to find out how many words he has left: 400 words - 300 words = 100 words.

Input:
Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randy’s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To find out how many biscuits Randy is left with, we need to follow the events step by step:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift, so we add these to the initial amount: 32 + 13 = 45 biscuits.
3. Then, his mother gave him 15 biscuits, so we add these to the total: 45 + 15 = 60 biscuits.
4. Finally, Randy's brother ate 20 biscuits, so we subtract these from the total: 60 - 20 = 40 biscuits.

Therefore, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Lana had 8 blank pages left in her binder, but she knew she would need more for her next class. Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder out and gave them to her. How many pages does Lana have in her binder after adding Duane’s?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many pages Duane gave to Lana. Since Duane took half of the 42 pages in his binder, we need to divide 42 by 2.
42 / 2 = 21

So, Duane gave 21 pages to Lana.

2. Now, we need to add the pages Duane gave to Lana to the pages Lana already had in her binder. Lana had 8 pages initially, and she received 21 pages from Duane.
8 + 21 = 29

Therefore, Lana now has 29 pages in her binder.

Input:
Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce, who has 20 more than Kent.  If Kent has 40 legos, how many does Simon have?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps.

First, we know that Kent has 40 legos. Since Bruce has 20 more legos than Kent, we can calculate the number of legos Bruce has by adding 20 to Kent's total:

40 (Kent's legos) + 20 = 60

So, Bruce has 60 legos.

Next, we know that Simon has 20% more legos than Bruce. To find 20% of Bruce's legos, we can multiply Bruce's total by 0.20:

60 (Bruce's legos) * 0.20 = 12

This means that Simon has 12 more legos than Bruce. To find Simon's total, we can add 12 to Bruce's total:

60 (Bruce's legos) + 12 = 72

Therefore, Simon has <final_answer>72</final_answer> legos.
