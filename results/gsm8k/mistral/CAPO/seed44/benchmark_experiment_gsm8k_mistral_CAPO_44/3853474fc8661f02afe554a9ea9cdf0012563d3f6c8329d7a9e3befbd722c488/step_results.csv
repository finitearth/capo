Input: Calvin is a bug collector.  In his collection, he has 12 giant roaches, 3 scorpions, half as many crickets as roaches, and twice as many caterpillars as scorpions.  How many insects does Calvin have in his collection?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the number of each type of insect and then sum them up.

1. **Giant Roaches**: Calvin has 12 giant roaches.
2. **Scorpions**: Calvin has 3 scorpions.
3. **Crickets**: Calvin has half as many crickets as roaches. Since he has 12 roaches, he has \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) crickets.
4. **Caterpillars**: Calvin has twice as many caterpillars as scorpions. Since he has 3 scorpions, he has \( 2 \times 3 = 6 \) caterpillars.

Now, we sum up all the insects:

Input: Cheryl got angry with her sister and decided to run away from home. She walked 2 miles every hour for 3 hours. Then she got homesick and walked back home. How many miles did Cheryl walk in total?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Cheryl walked. We can break it down into two parts: the distance she walked away from home and the distance she walked back home.

1. **Distance away from home:**
   - Cheryl walked 2 miles every hour for 3 hours.
   - Total distance away from home = 2 miles/hour * 3 hours = 6 miles.

2. **Distance back home:**
   - Cheryl walked back the same distance she traveled away from home.
   - Total distance back home = 6 miles.

3. **Total distance walked:**
   - Total distance = distance away from home + distance back home = 6 miles + 6 miles = 12 miles.

Input: Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the variables**:
   Let \( c$ be the number of cucumbers.
   Let $t$ be the number of tomatoes.

2. **Set up the equations based on the problem:
   - The total number of vegetables is 280.
   - There are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers.

   Therefore, we have:
   \[ c + t = 280 \]
   \[ t = 3c \]

3. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
   \[ c + 3c = 280 \]
   \[ 4c = 280\]

4. **Solve for $c$:
   \[ c = \frac{280}{4} \]
    \[ c = 70\]

So, the number of cucumbers used in the salad is 70.

Input: Alice wants 1000 folded paper cranes. She folds half by herself, and a friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranes for her. How many paper cranes does Alice still need to fold?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to break it down step by step:

1. **Total number of paper cranes**: Alice wants 1000 paper cranines.
2. **Alice folds half of the paper cranines**: Alice folds half of 1000, which is:
   \[ \frac{1000}{2} = 500 \]

4. **Friend folds a fifth of the remaining paper cranines**: The friend folds a fifth of 500, which is:
   \[ \frac{500}{5} = 100 \]
5. **Remaining paper cranines after the friend folds**: After the friend folds 100, the remaining number of paper cranines is:
   \[ 500 - 100 = 400 \]

Therefore, Alice still needs to fold 400 paper cranines.

Input: Cheryl got angry with her sister and decided to run away from home. She walked 2 miles every hour for 3 hours. Then she got homesick and walked back home. How many miles did Cheryl walk in total?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Cheryl walked. We can break it down into two parts: the distance she walked away from home and the distance she walked back home.

1. **Distance away from home:**
   - Cheryl walked 2 miles every hour for 3 hours.
   - Total distance away from home = 2 miles/hour * 3 hours = 6 miles.

2. **Distance back home:**
   - Cheryl walked back the same distance she traveled away from home.
   - Total distance back home = 6 miles.

3. **Total distance walked:**
   - Total distance = distance away from home + distance back home = 6 miles + 6 miles = 12 miles.

Input: Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the variables**:
   Let \( c$ be the number of cucumbers.
   Let $t$ be the number of tomatoes.

2. **Set up the equations based on the problem:
   - The total number of vegetables is 280.
   - There are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers.

   Therefore, we have:
   \[ c + t = 280 \]
   \[ t = 3c \]

3. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
   \[ c + 3c = 280 \]
   \[ 4c = 280\]

4. **Solve for $c$:
   \[ c = \frac{280}{4} \]
    \[ c = 70\]

So, the number of cucumbers used in the salad is 70.

Input: Barry wants to make a huge salad using only cucumbers and tomatoes. He will use a total of 280 pieces of vegetables. If there are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers, how many cucumbers will be used in the salad?
Output: To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Define the variables**:
   Let \( c$ be the number of cucumbers.
   Let $t$ be the number of tomatoes.

2. **Set up the equations based on the problem:
   - The total number of vegetables is 280.
   - There are thrice as many tomatoes as cucumbers.

   Therefore, we have:
   \[ c + t = 280 \]
   \[ t = 3c \]

3. **Substitute the second equation into the first equation:
   \[ c + 3c = 280 \]
   \[ 4c = 280\]

4. **Solve for $c$:
   \[ c = \frac{280}{4} \]
    \[ c = 70\]

So, the number of cucumbers used in the salad is 70.

Input: Cheryl got angry with her sister and decided to run away from home. She walked 2 miles every hour for 3 hours. Then she got homesick and walked back home. How many miles did Cheryl walk in total?
Output: To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total distance Cheryl walked. We can break it down into two parts: the distance she walked away from home and the distance she walked back home.

1. **Distance away from home:**
   - Cheryl walked 2 miles every hour for 3 hours.
   - Total distance away from home = 2 miles/hour * 3 hours = 6 miles.

2. **Distance back home:**
   - Cheryl walked back the same distance she traveled away from home.
   - Total distance back home = 6 miles.

3. **Total distance walked:**
   - Total distance = distance away from home + distance back home = 6 miles + 6 miles = 12 miles.
