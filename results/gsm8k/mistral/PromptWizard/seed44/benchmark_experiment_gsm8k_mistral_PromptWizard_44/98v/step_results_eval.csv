1,"The dataset consists of grade school math word problems that require multi-step reasoning to solve. The task is to solve each word problem and provide the final answer. The final solution will be extracted between the markers <final_answer>answer</final_answer>.

To tackle this elementary math problem, we need to devise a structured experiment that breaks the problem into logical steps. Start by identifying the key assumptions underlying the problem. Simplify the problem by breaking it into smaller, manageable parts. Measure progress by tracking the steps completed and the accuracy of each step. Apply different methods to solve the problem, such as using algebraic equations or logical reasoning. Finally, enclose the final answer with <final_answer> and </final_answer> markers for clarity.

To devise an experiment, consider the following steps:

1. **Break the problem into smaller parts**:
   - Identify the key components of the problem.
   - Break down the problem into manageable parts.

2. **Identify the key assumptions underlying the problem**:
   - Determine the assumptions that are essential for solving the problem.
   - Ensure that these assumptions are clearly stated.

3. **Simplify the problem by breaking it into smaller, manageable parts**:
   - Break down the problem into smaller parts that can be easily solved.
   - Ensure that each part is clearly defined and understandable.

4. **Measure progress by tracking the steps completed and the accuracy of each step**:
   - Track the

Here is an example of how you would solve a word problem:

**Problem:** A farmer has a rectangular field with a length of 100 meters and a width of 50 meters. The farmer wants to plant trees along the perimeter of the field. If each tree requires 2 meters of space, how many trees can the farmer plant?

**Solution:**

1. Calculate the perimeter of the rectangular field:
   Perimeter = 2 * (length + width) = 2 * (100 + 50) = 2 * 150 = 300 meters.

2. Determine the number of trees that can be planted:
