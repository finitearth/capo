1,"The dataset consists of grade school math word problems that require multi-step reasoning to solve. The task is to solve each word problem and provide the final answer. The final solution will be extracted between the markers <final_answer>answer</final_answer>.

To solve the grade school math word problems that require multi-step reasoning, follow these steps:

1. **Break down the problem into smaller parts**: Identify the key components of the problem and break it down into smaller, manageable parts.
2. **Solve each part individually**: For each part, apply the necessary mathematical operations to solve it.
3. **Combine the solutions: Once each part is solved, combine the solutions to get the final answer.
4. **Format the final answer: Ensure the final answer is formatted between <final_answer> tags.

### Example:
**Question:** Elsa and her sister watch an opera show every year at Central City Opera. Last year, opera seating cost $85 per ticket. This year, it costs $102. What is the percent increase in the cost of each ticket?

**Solution:**
1. Calculate the increase in cost: $102 - $85 = $17.
2. Calculate the percentage increase: ($17 / $85) * 100 = 20%.

**Final Answer:**
<final_answer>20</final_answer>

### Key Assum


[Question] Maria is planning to buy a new car that costs $25,000. She has saved $15,000 for the car. She was awarded a grant that will cover 30% of the remainder of her car cost. How much will Maria need to apply for to receive a loan that will cover her car cost?
[Answer] To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the remaining cost of the car:**
   - The total cost of the car is $25,000.
   - Maria has saved $15,000.
   - The remaining cost is $25,000 - $15,000 = $10,000.

2. **Calculate the amount covered by the grant:**
   - The grant covers 30% of the remaining cost.
   - The amount covered by the grant is 30% of $10,000 = 0.3 * $10,000 = $3,000.

3. **Calculate the amount Maria needs to apply for a loan:**
   - The remaining cost after the grant is $10,000 - $3,000 = $7,000.

**Final Answer:**
<final_answer>7,000</final_answer> <ANS_START>10,500<ANS_END>

[Question] Three runners are competing in a 15-mile race. The first runs at an average pace of 7 minutes per mile, the second runs at an average pace of 6 minutes per mile, and the third runs at an average pace of 5 minutes per mile. After 60 minutes, the second runner stops for a drink of water. For how many minutes could the second runner remain stopped before the first runner catches up with him?
[Answer] To solve the problem, we need to determine how long the second runner can remain stopped before the first runner catches up with him. Here is the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Calculate the distance covered by the second runner in 60 minutes:**
   - The second runner runs at a pace of 6 minutes per mile.
   - In 60 minutes, the second runner covers \( \frac{60}{6} = 10$ miles.

2. **Calculate the distance covered by the first runner in 60 minutes:**
   - The first runner runs at a pace of 7 minutes per mile.
   - In 60 minutes, the first runner covers $ \frac{60}{7} = 8.57$ miles.

3. **Determine the remaining distance for the first runner to catch up with the second runner:**
   - The second runner has covered 10 miles.
   - The first runner has covered 8.57 miles.
   - The remaining distance for the first runner to catch up is $10 - 8.57 = 1.43$ miles.

4. **Calculate the time it takes for the first runner to cover the remaining distance:
   - The <ANS_START>10<ANS_END>
