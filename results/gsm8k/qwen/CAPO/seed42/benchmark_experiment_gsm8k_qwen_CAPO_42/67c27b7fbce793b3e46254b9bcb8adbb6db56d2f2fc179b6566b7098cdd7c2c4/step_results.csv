The association wanted every other tree to be a fruit tree, and they agreed to plant equal numbers of plum, pear, and apricot trees. How many of each kind of tree will they plant?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of trees to be planted.
2. Identify how many of these trees will be fruit trees.
3. Calculate the number of each type of fruit tree.

Step 1: Determine the total number of trees to be planted.
- There are 18 streets in the neighborhood.
- Therefore, the total number of trees to be planted is 18.

Step 2: Identify how many of these trees will be fruit trees.
- The association wanted every other tree to be a fruit tree.
- This means half of the trees will be fruit trees.
- Half of 18 is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
- Therefore, there will be 9 fruit trees.

Step 3: Calculate the number of each type of fruit tree.
- The association agreed to plant equal numbers of plum, pear, and apricot trees.
- There are 3 types of fruit trees.
- Therefore, the number of each type of fruit tree will be \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \).

Input: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ribbon will be used in total and then subtract that from the total amount of ribbon Josh has.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of ribbon used for the gifts.
Each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Subtract the total ribbon used from the total ribbon Josh has.
Josh has 18 yards of ribbon.
So, the remaining ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Angeli ate 3/2 slices and Marlon ate 3/2 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate together, we add these two quantities.

3/2 + 3/2 = 6/2 = 3 slices

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices left.
The pizza was cut into 8 slices. Angeli and Marlon together ate 3 slices. To find the number of slices left, we subtract the number of slices they ate from the total number of slices.

8 - 3 = 5 slices

Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of packages the courier received over the two days and then determine how many packages should be delivered tomorrow.

Step 1: Calculate the number of packages received today.
The problem states that the courier received twice as many packages today as yesterday. Since the courier received 80 packages yesterday, the number of packages received today is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of packages received over the two days.
The total number of packages received is the sum of the packages received yesterday and today:
\[ 80 + 160 = 240 \]

Step 3: Determine the number of packages to be delivered tomorrow.
Since all the packages received over the two days should be delivered tomorrow, the number of packages to be delivered tomorrow is the total number of packages received:
\[ 240 \]

Therefore, the number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow is:

Next, we need to determine how many cookies are left uneaten. Since the class eats half of the cookies, the number of uneaten cookies is:

\[ \frac{48}{2} = 24 \]

Each cookie has exactly 7 chocolate chips. Therefore, the total number of chocolate chips in the uneaten cookies is:

\[ 24 \times 7 = 168 \]

So, the number of chocolate chips left uneaten is:

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of trees to be planted.
2. Identify how many of these trees will be fruit trees.
3. Calculate the number of each type of fruit tree.

Step 1: Determine the total number of trees to be planted.
- There are 18 streets in the neighborhood.
- Therefore, the total number of trees to be planted is 18.

Step 2: Identify how many of these trees will be fruit trees.
- The association wanted every other tree to be a fruit tree.
- This means half of the trees will be fruit trees.
- Half of 18 is \( \frac{18}{2} = 9 \).
- Therefore, there will be 9 fruit trees.

Step 3: Calculate the number of each type of fruit tree.
- The association agreed to plant equal numbers of plum, pear, and apricot trees.
- There are 3 types of fruit trees.
- Therefore, the number of each type of fruit tree will be \( \frac{9}{3} = 3 \).

Input: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ribbon will be used in total and then subtract that from the total amount of ribbon Josh has.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of ribbon used for the gifts.
Each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Subtract the total ribbon used from the total ribbon Josh has.
Josh has 18 yards of ribbon.
So, the remaining ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Input: A courier received 80 packages yesterday and twice as many today.  All of these should be delivered tomorrow. How many packages should be delivered tomorrow?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of packages the courier received over the two days and then determine how many packages should be delivered tomorrow.

Step 1: Calculate the number of packages received today.
The problem states that the courier received twice as many packages today as yesterday. Since the courier received 80 packages yesterday, the number of packages received today is:
\[ 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Step 2: Calculate the total number of packages received over the two days.
The total number of packages received is the sum of the packages received yesterday and today:
\[ 80 + 160 = 240 \]

Step 3: Determine the number of packages to be delivered tomorrow.
Since all the packages received over the two days should be delivered tomorrow, the number of packages to be delivered tomorrow is the total number of packages received:
\[ 240 \]

Therefore, the number of packages that should be delivered tomorrow is:

Becky buys 5 new necklaces that week. She decides to give 15 of her old necklaces to her friends as gifts. How many necklaces does she own now?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Count**: Becky starts with 50 necklaces.
   - Initial number of necklaces = 50

2. **Broken Necklaces**: Becky has 3 necklaces with broken beads. She discards these necklaces.
   - Necklaces after discarding broken ones = 50 - 3 = 47

3. **New Purchases**: Becky buys 5 new necklaces.
   - Necklaces after buying new ones = 47 + 5 = 52

4. **Gifts Given Away**: Becky gives 15 of her old necklaces to her friends.
   - Necklaces after giving away = 52 - 15 = 37

Thus, after all these transactions, Becky now owns 37 necklaces.

Input: Mr Fletcher hired 2 men to dig a well in his compound. They worked for 10 hours on the first day, 8 hours on the second day and finished the job on the third day after working 15 hours. If Mr Fletcher paid each of them $10 per hour of work, calculate the total amount of money they received altogether?
Output: userHeaderCode：
user
To calculate the total amount of money the two men received altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours each man worked.
2. Multiply the total hours by the hourly rate to find the total payment for each man.
3. Sum the payments for both men to get the total amount received.

Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by each man:**
   - First day: 10 hours
   - Second day: 8 hours
   - Third day: 15 hours

   Total hours worked by each man = 10 + 8 + 15 = 33 hours

2. **Calculate the payment for each man:**
   - Hourly rate = $10 per hour
   - Payment for each man = 33 hours * $10/hour = $330

3. **Calculate the total payment for both men:**
   - Total payment for both men = 2 * $330 = $660

Therefore, the total amount of money they received altogether is:

Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of trees to be planted.
2. Identify how many of these trees will be fruit trees.
3. Calculate the number of each type of fruit tree.

Step 1: Determine the total number of trees to be planted.

Input: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ribbon will be used in total and then subtract that from the total amount of ribbon Josh has.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of ribbon used for the gifts.
Each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Subtract the total ribbon used from the total ribbon Josh has.
Josh has 18 yards of ribbon.
So, the remaining ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Input: Becky has 50 necklaces in her jewelry collection. 3 of the necklaces have broken beads so she collects the unbroken beads for crafting and throws the other parts of the 3 the necklaces out. Becky buys 5 new necklaces that week. She decides to give 15 of her old necklaces to her friends as gifts. How many necklaces does she own now?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Count**: Becky starts with 50 necklaces.
   - Initial number of necklaces = 50

2. **Broken Necklaces**: Becky has 3 necklaces with broken beads. She discards these necklaces.
   - Necklaces after discarding broken ones = 50 - 3 = 47

3. **New Purchases**: Becky buys 5 new necklaces.
   - Necklaces after buying new ones = 47 + 5 = 52

4. **Gifts Given Away**: Becky gives 15 of her old necklaces to her friends.
   - Necklaces after giving away = 52 - 15 = 37

Thus, after all these transactions, Becky now owns 37 necklaces.

Input: Mr Fletcher hired 2 men to dig a well in his compound. They worked for 10 hours on the first day, 8 hours on the second day and finished the job on the third day after working 15 hours. If Mr Fletcher paid each of them $10 per hour of work, calculate the total amount of money they received altogether?
Output: userHeaderCode：
user
To calculate the total amount of money the two men received altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours each man worked.
2. Multiply the total hours by the hourly rate to find the total payment for each man.
3. Sum the payments for both men to get the total amount received.

Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by each man:**
   - First day: 10 hours
   - Second day: 8 hours
   - Third day: 15 hours

   Total hours worked by each man = 10 + 8 + 15 = 33 hours

2. **Calculate the payment for each man:**
   - Hourly rate = $10 per hour
   - Payment for each man = 33 hours * $10/hour = $330

3. **Calculate the total payment for both men:**
   - Total payment for both men = 2 * $330 = $660

Therefore, the total amount of money they received altogether is:

Input: Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how much ribbon will be used in total and then subtract that from the total amount of ribbon Josh has.

Step 1: Calculate the total amount of ribbon used for the gifts.
Each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Subtract the total ribbon used from the total ribbon Josh has.
Josh has 18 yards of ribbon.
So, the remaining ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Input: A whole pizza was cut into 8 slices. Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. How many slices of pizza are left?
Output: user
Step 1: Determine the total number of slices eaten by Angeli and Marlon.
Angeli ate 3/2 slices and Marlon ate 3/2 slices. To find the total number of slices they ate together, we add these two quantities.

3/2 + 3/2 = 6/2 = 3 slices

Step 2: Calculate the number of slices left.
The pizza was cut into 8 slices. Angeli and Marlon together ate 3 slices. To find the number of slices left, we subtract the number of slices they ate from the total number of slices.

8 - 3 = 5 slices

Input: Becky has 50 necklaces in her jewelry collection. 3 of the necklaces have broken beads so she collects the unbroken beads for crafting and throws the other parts of the 3 the necklaces out. Becky buys 5 new necklaces that week. She decides to give 15 of her old necklaces to her friends as gifts. How many necklaces does she own now?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to follow the sequence of events and perform the necessary calculations step by step.

1. **Initial Count**: Becky starts with 50 necklaces.
   - Initial number of necklaces = 50

2. **Broken Necklaces**: Becky has 3 necklaces with broken beads. She discards these necklaces.
   - Necklaces after discarding broken ones = 50 - 3 = 47

3. **New Purchases**: Becky buys 5 new necklaces.
   - Necklaces after buying new ones = 47 + 5 = 52

4. **Gifts Given Away**: Becky gives 15 of her old necklaces to her friends.
   - Necklaces after giving away = 52 - 15 = 37

Thus, after all these transactions, Becky now owns 37 necklaces.

Input: Mr Fletcher hired 2 men to dig a well in his compound. They worked for 10 hours on the first day, 8 hours on the second day and finished the job on the third day after working 15 hours. If Mr Fletcher paid each of them $10 per hour of work, calculate the total amount of money they received altogether?
Output: userHeaderCode：
user
To calculate the total amount of money the two men received altogether, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours each man worked.
2. Multiply the total hours by the hourly rate to find the total payment for each man.
3. Sum the payments for both men to get the total amount received.

Let's break it down:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours worked by each man:**
   - First day: 10 hours
   - Second day: 8 hours
   - Third day: 15 hours

   Total hours worked by each man = 10 + 8 + 15 = 33 hours

2. **Calculate the payment for each man:**
   - Hourly rate = $10 per hour
   - Payment for each man = 33 hours * $10/hour = $330

3. **Calculate the total payment for both men:**
   - Total payment for both men = 2 * $330 = $660

Therefore, the total amount of money they received altogether is:

Input: During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to break it down into steps and use the information given to find out how many necklaces Latch caught.

1. **Identify the number of necklaces Boudreaux caught:**
   - Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces.

2. **Determine the number of necklaces Rhonda caught:**
   - Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.
   - Therefore, Rhonda caught \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) necklaces.

3. **Calculate the number of necklaces Latch caught:**
   - Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.
   - First, calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \).
   - Then, subtract four from this result: \( 18 - 4 = 14 \).

Thus, Latch caught 14 necklaces.
