Jeremie wants to go to an amusement park with 3 friends at the end of summer. Tickets are $18 for children and a set of snack cost $5. How much will it cost Jeremie and her 3 friends to go to the amusement park and buy each of them a set of snacks?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total cost for Jeremie and her 3 friends to go to the amusement park and buy each of them a set of snacks.

Step 1: Calculate the total number of people going to the amusement park.
- Jeremie + 3 friends = 4 people

Step 2: Calculate the total cost for amusement park tickets.
- Cost per ticket = $18
- Total cost for tickets = 4 people * $18 per ticket = $72

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for snacks.
- Cost per set of snacks = $5
- Total cost for snacks = 4 people * $5 per set = $20

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for amusement park tickets and snacks.
- Total cost = Total cost for tickets + Total cost for snacks
- Total cost = $72 + $20 = $92

During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the relationships given step by step.

1. **Identify the number of necklaces Boudreaux caught:**
   - Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces.

2. **Determine the number of necklaces Rhonda caught:**
   - Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.
   - Therefore, Rhonda caught \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) necklaces.

3. **Determine the number of necklaces Latch caught:**
   - Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.
   - First, calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \).
   - Then, subtract four from this result: \( 18 - 4 = 14 \).

Thus, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of ribbon that will be used for all the gifts.
2. Subtract the total used ribbon from the initial amount of ribbon to find out how much ribbon will be left.

Step 1: Calculate the total ribbon used for all gifts.
Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining ribbon.
Josh initially has 18 yards of ribbon.
The total ribbon used is 12 yards.
So, the remaining ribbon = Initial ribbon - Used ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

A whole pizza was cut into 8 slices. Angeli and Marlon ate 3/2 slices each. How many slices of pizza are left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total number of slices eaten by Angeli and Marlon.
2. Subtract the total number of slices eaten from the initial number of slices.

Step 1: Angeli and Marlon each ate 3/2 slices. Since there are two people, we multiply 3/2 by 2 to find the total number of slices eaten:
\[ \frac{3}{2} \times 2 = 3 \text{ slices} \]

Step 2: The pizza was initially cut into 8 slices. We subtract the 3 slices eaten from the initial 8 slices:
\[ 8 - 3 = 5 \text{ slices} \]

Therefore, the number of slices of pizza left is <final_answer>5</final_answer>.

Megan went to the store and bought a dozen eggs. When she got home, her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs from her chickens. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet for dinner and 4 eggs to bake a cake. When Megan's aunt came over for a visit, Megan gave her half of her remaining eggs. How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Megan bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she received another 12 eggs.
3. Therefore, Megan now has a total of 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
4. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used a total of 2 + 4 = 6 eggs.
5. After using these eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs remaining.
6. Megan then gave half of her remaining eggs to her aunt. Half of 18 eggs is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs.
7. After giving these eggs to her aunt, Megan has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
8. Megan plans to divide these remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. So, she will have 9 / 3 = 3 eggs per meal.

Input:
Monica was saving money for her future. Every week he put $15 into her moneybox. After the moneybox got full, which took 60 weeks, Monica took all the money out and took it to the bank, and she started saving money again. She repeated this whole process 5 times. How much money did Monica take to the bank in total?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Monica saved over the 5 cycles of saving.

1. First, we calculate how much money Monica saved in one cycle:
   - She saves $15 every week.
   - It takes her 60 weeks to fill the moneybox.
   - Therefore, in one cycle, she saves \( 15 \times 60 \) dollars.

2. Next, we calculate the total amount saved over 5 cycles:
   - Each cycle saves \( 15 \times 60 \) dollars.
   - Over 5 cycles, the total amount saved is \( 5 \times (15 \times 60) \).

Let's perform the calculations:

- Amount saved in one cycle: \( 15 \times 60 = 900 \) dollars.
- Total amount saved over 5 cycles: \( 5 \times 900 = 4500 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Monica took to the bank is:

Input:
Bert bought some unique stamps for his collection. Before the purchase, he had only half the stamps he bought. If he bought 300 stamps, how many stamps does Bert have in total after the purchase?
Output:
Let's solve this step-by-step:

1. Let's denote the number of stamps Bert had before the purchase as \( S \).

2. According to the problem, before the purchase, Bert had only half the number of stamps he bought. Since he bought 300 stamps, we can write:
   \[
   S = \frac{1}{2} \times 300
   \]

3. Calculate \( S \):
   \[
   S = \frac{300}{2} = 150
   \]

4. After the purchase, Bert's total number of stamps is the sum of the stamps he had before and the stamps he bought:
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = S + 300
   \]

5. Substitute the value of \( S \):
   \[
   \text{Total stamps} = 150 + 300 = 450
   \]

Therefore, the total number of stamps Bert has after the purchase is <final_answer>450</final_answer>.

\[ 31 \text{ tables} \times 2 \text{ fish/table} = 62 \text{ fish} \]

Step 2: Add the number of fish in the one table with 3 fish.

- Cost per set of snacks = $5
- Total cost for snacks = 4 people * $5 per set = $20

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for amusement park tickets and snacks.
- Total cost = Total cost for tickets + Total cost for snacks
- Total cost = $72 + $20 = $92

How many eggs per meal would Megan have if she plans to divide what she has left equally for her next 3 meals?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Megan bought a dozen eggs, which is 12 eggs.
2. Her neighbor gave her another dozen eggs, so she received another 12 eggs.
3. Therefore, Megan now has a total of 12 + 12 = 24 eggs.
4. Megan used 2 eggs to make an omelet and 4 eggs to bake a cake, so she used a total of 2 + 4 = 6 eggs.
5. After using these eggs, Megan has 24 - 6 = 18 eggs remaining.
6. Megan then gave half of her remaining eggs to her aunt. Half of 18 eggs is 18 / 2 = 9 eggs.
7. After giving these eggs to her aunt, Megan has 18 - 9 = 9 eggs left.
8. Megan plans to divide these remaining eggs equally for her next 3 meals. So, she will have 9 / 3 = 3 eggs per meal.

Input:
Monica was saving money for her future. Every week he put $15 into her moneybox. After the moneybox got full, which took 60 weeks, Monica took all the money out and took it to the bank, and she started saving money again. She repeated this whole process 5 times. How much money did Monica take to the bank in total?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total amount of money Monica saved over the 5 cycles of saving.

1. First, we calculate how much money Monica saved in one cycle:
   - She saves $15 every week.
   - It takes her 60 weeks to fill the moneybox.
   - Therefore, in one cycle, she saves \( 15 \times 60 \) dollars.

2. Next, we calculate the total amount saved over 5 cycles:
   - Each cycle saves \( 15 \times 60 \) dollars.
   - Over 5 cycles, the total amount saved is \( 5 \times (15 \times 60) \).

Let's perform the calculations:

- Amount saved in one cycle: \( 15 \times 60 = 900 \) dollars.
- Total amount saved over 5 cycles: \( 5 \times 900 = 4500 \) dollars.

Therefore, the total amount of money Monica took to the bank is:

The centerpieces at Glenda’s wedding reception include a fishbowl containing 2 fish, except for one table that has 3 fish. There are 32 tables. How many fish are there?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to calculate the total number of fish in all the fishbowls across the 32 tables. We know that 31 tables have 2 fish each, and 1 table has 3 fish.

Step 1: Calculate the number of fish in the 31 tables with 2 fish each.
\[ 31 \text{ tables} \times 2 \text{ fish/table} = 62 \text{ fish} \]

Step 2: Add the number of fish in the one table with 3 fish.
\[ 62 \text{ fish} + 3 \text{ fish} = 65 \text{ fish} \]

So, the total number of fish is 65.

Step 3: Calculate the total cost for snacks.
- Cost per set of snacks = $5
- Total cost for snacks = 4 people * $5 per set = $20

Step 4: Calculate the total cost for amusement park tickets and snacks.
- Total cost = Total cost for tickets + Total cost for snacks
- Total cost = $72 + $20 = $92

So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining ribbon.
Josh initially has 18 yards of ribbon.
The total ribbon used is 12 yards.
So, the remaining ribbon = Initial ribbon - Used ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the relationships given step by step.

1. **Identify the number of necklaces Boudreaux caught:**
   - Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces.

2. **Determine the number of necklaces Rhonda caught:**
   - Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.
   - Therefore, Rhonda caught \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) necklaces.

3. **Determine the number of necklaces Latch caught:**
   - Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.
   - First, calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \).
   - Then, subtract four from this result: \( 18 - 4 = 14 \).

Thus, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of ribbon that will be used for all the gifts.
2. Subtract the total used ribbon from the initial amount of ribbon to find out how much ribbon will be left.

Step 1: Calculate the total ribbon used for all gifts.
Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining ribbon.
Josh initially has 18 yards of ribbon.
The total ribbon used is 12 yards.
So, the remaining ribbon = Initial ribbon - Used ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the relationships given step by step.

1. **Identify the number of necklaces Boudreaux caught:**
   - Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces.

2. **Determine the number of necklaces Rhonda caught:**
   - Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.
   - Therefore, Rhonda caught \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) necklaces.

3. **Determine the number of necklaces Latch caught:**
   - Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.
   - First, calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \).
   - Then, subtract four from this result: \( 18 - 4 = 14 \).

Thus, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

   - Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.
   - Therefore, Rhonda caught \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) necklaces.

3. **Determine the number of necklaces Latch caught:**
   - Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.
   - First, calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \).
   - Then, subtract four from this result: \( 18 - 4 = 14 \).

Thus, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of ribbon that will be used for all the gifts.
2. Subtract the total used ribbon from the initial amount of ribbon to find out how much ribbon will be left.

Step 1: Calculate the total ribbon used for all gifts.
Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining ribbon.
Josh initially has 18 yards of ribbon.
The total ribbon used is 12 yards.
So, the remaining ribbon = Initial ribbon - Used ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

During the Mardi Gras parade, Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as did Rhonda.  If Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as did Boudreaux, and Boudreaux caught twelve necklaces, how many necklaces did Latch catch?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow the relationships given step by step.

1. **Identify the number of necklaces Boudreaux caught:**
   - Boudreaux caught 12 necklaces.

2. **Determine the number of necklaces Rhonda caught:**
   - Rhonda caught half as many necklaces as Boudreaux.
   - Therefore, Rhonda caught \( \frac{12}{2} = 6 \) necklaces.

3. **Determine the number of necklaces Latch caught:**
   - Latch caught four less than three times as many necklaces as Rhonda.
   - First, calculate three times the number of necklaces Rhonda caught: \( 3 \times 6 = 18 \).
   - Then, subtract four from this result: \( 18 - 4 = 14 \).

Thus, Latch caught 14 necklaces.

1. Determine the total amount of ribbon that will be used for all the gifts.
2. Subtract the total used ribbon from the initial amount of ribbon to find out how much ribbon will be left.

Step 1: Calculate the total ribbon used for all gifts.
Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining ribbon.
Josh initially has 18 yards of ribbon.
The total ribbon used is 12 yards.
So, the remaining ribbon = Initial ribbon - Used ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of ribbon that will be used for all the gifts.
2. Subtract the total used ribbon from the initial amount of ribbon to find out how much ribbon will be left.

Step 1: Calculate the total ribbon used for all gifts.
Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining ribbon.
Josh initially has 18 yards of ribbon.
The total ribbon used is 12 yards.
So, the remaining ribbon = Initial ribbon - Used ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Input:
Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of ribbon that will be used for all the gifts.
2. Subtract the total used ribbon from the initial amount of ribbon to find out how much ribbon will be left.

Step 1: Calculate the total ribbon used for all gifts.
Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining ribbon.
Josh initially has 18 yards of ribbon.
The total ribbon used is 12 yards.
So, the remaining ribbon = Initial ribbon - Used ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.

Input:
Josh has 18 yards of ribbon that is to be used equally to 6 gifts. If each gift will use 2 yards of ribbon, how many yards of ribbon will be left?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the total amount of ribbon that will be used for all the gifts.
2. Subtract the total used ribbon from the initial amount of ribbon to find out how much ribbon will be left.

Step 1: Calculate the total ribbon used for all gifts.
Each gift uses 2 yards of ribbon, and there are 6 gifts.
So, the total ribbon used = 2 yards/gift * 6 gifts = 12 yards.

Step 2: Calculate the remaining ribbon.
Josh initially has 18 yards of ribbon.
The total ribbon used is 12 yards.
So, the remaining ribbon = Initial ribbon - Used ribbon = 18 yards - 12 yards = 6 yards.
