Input:
A school is planning a community outreach program. Each classroom must raise $200 for this activity. Classroom A has raised $20 from each of two families, $10 from each of eight families, and $5  from each of ten families. How much more money does Classroom A need in order to reach the goal?
Output:
To determine how much more money Classroom A needs to reach its goal, we first need to calculate the total amount of money raised so far.

1. Calculate the total amount raised from the two families who each contributed $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

2. Calculate the total amount raised from the eight families who each contributed $10:
\[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \]

3. Calculate the total amount raised from the ten families who each contributed $5:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

4. Add these amounts together to find the total amount raised so far:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \]

5. The goal is to raise $200. Subtract the amount raised so far from the goal to find out how much more is needed:
\[ 200 - 170 = 30 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Classroom A still needs to reach the goal is:

Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of books Amanda read:**
   - Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda.
   - Candice read 18 books.
   - Therefore, Amanda read \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) books.

2. **Determine the number of books Kara read:**
   - Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read.
   - Amanda read 6 books.
   - Therefore, Kara read \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) books.

3. **Calculate the number of books Patricia read:**
   - Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read.
   - Kara read 3 books.
   - Therefore, Patricia read \( 7 \times 3 = 21 \) books.

Thus, the number of books Patricia read is <final_answer>21</final_answer>.

Julieta went to the store to buy a backpack and three ring-binders for her school supplies. She knew the backpack was $50, and each ring-binder cost was $20. However, at the store, she found out that the price of a back had increased by $5, and the price of a ring-binder had reduced by $2. Calculate the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store.
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Prices:**
   - Backpack: $50
   - Ring-binder: $20

2. **Price Changes:**
   - Backpack price increased by $5.
   - Ring-binder price reduced by $2.

3. **New Prices:**
   - New price of the backpack: $50 + $5 = $55
   - New price of each ring-binder: $20 - $2 = $18

4. **Quantity Purchased:**
   - Julieta bought 1 backpack and 3 ring-binders.

5. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost of the backpack: $55
   - Cost of 3 ring-binders: 3 * $18 = $54

6. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the backpack + Cost of the ring-binders
   - Total cost = $55 + $54 = $109

Therefore, the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store is <final_answer>109</final_answer>.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randy’s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of biscuits Randy had.
2. Add the biscuits given by his father.
3. Add the biscuits given by his mother.
4. Subtract the biscuits eaten by his brother.

Let's break it down:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 more biscuits:
   \[
   32 + 13 = 45
   \]
3. His mother gave him 15 more biscuits:
   \[
   45 + 15 = 60
   \]
4. His brother ate 20 biscuits:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

1. Georgia starts with 75 problems.
2. After 20 minutes, she has completed 10 problems. So, the number of problems left at this point is:
   \[
   75 - 10 = 65 \text{ problems}
   \]
3. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems as she did in the first 20 minutes. Since she completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes, she completes:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ problems}
   \]
   in the next 20 minutes. So, the total number of problems she has completed after 40 minutes is:
   \[
   10 + 20 = 30 \text{ problems}
   \]
4. The number of problems left after 40 minutes is:
   \[
   75 - 30 = 45 \text{ problems}
   \]

Therefore, the number of problems Georgia has left to solve is 45.

On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
Step 1: Calculate the weekly milk production per cow.
To do this, we can divide the total weekly milk production by the number of cows that produce it. So, 108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters/cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
To do this, we can multiply the weekly milk production per cow by the number of weeks. So, 18 liters/cow per week * 5 weeks = 90 liters/cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cows on the farm.
To do this, we can divide the total milk production over five weeks by the milk production per cow over five weeks. So, 2160 liters / 90 liters/cow = 24 cows.

Therefore, the number of cows on the farm is <final_answer>24</final_answer>.

On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
Step 1: Calculate the weekly milk production per cow.
To do this, we can divide the total weekly milk production by the number of cows that produce it. So, 108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters/cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
To do this, we can multiply the weekly milk production per cow by the number of weeks. So, 18 liters/cow per week * 5 weeks = 90 liters/cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cows on the farm.
To do this, we can divide the total milk production over five weeks by the milk production per cow over five weeks. So, 2160 liters / 90 liters/cow = 24 cows.

A school is planning a community outreach program. Each classroom must raise $200 for this activity. Classroom A has raised $20 from each of two families, $10 from each of eight families, and $5  from each of ten families. How much more money does Classroom A need in order to reach the goal?
Output:
To determine how much more money Classroom A needs to reach its goal, we first need to calculate the total amount of money raised so far.

1. Calculate the total amount raised from the two families who each contributed $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

2. Calculate the total amount raised from the eight families who each contributed $10:
\[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \]

3. Calculate the total amount raised from the ten families who each contributed $5:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

4. Add these amounts together to find the total amount raised so far:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \]

5. The goal is to raise $200. Subtract the amount raised so far from the goal to find out how much more is needed:
\[ 200 - 170 = 30 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Classroom A still needs to reach the goal is:

Input:
Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of books Amanda read:**
   - Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda.
   - Candice read 18 books.
   - Therefore, Amanda read \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) books.

2. **Determine the number of books Kara read:**
   - Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read.
   - Amanda read 6 books.
   - Therefore, Kara read \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) books.

3. **Calculate the number of books Patricia read:**
   - Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read.
   - Kara read 3 books.
   - Therefore, Patricia read \( 7 \times 3 = 21 \) books.

Thus, the number of books Patricia read is <final_answer>21</final_answer>.

Input:
Julieta went to the store to buy a backpack and three ring-binders for her school supplies. She knew the backpack was $50, and each ring-binder cost was $20. However, at the store, she found out that the price of a back had increased by $5, and the price of a ring-binder had reduced by $2. Calculate the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store.
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Prices:**
   - Backpack: $50
   - Ring-binder: $20

2. **Price Changes:**
   - Backpack price increased by $5.
   - Ring-binder price reduced by $2.

3. **New Prices:**
   - New price of the backpack: $50 + $5 = $55
   - New price of each ring-binder: $20 - $2 = $18

4. **Quantity Purchased:**
   - Julieta bought 1 backpack and 3 ring-binders.

5. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost of the backpack: $55
   - Cost of 3 ring-binders: 3 * $18 = $54

6. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the backpack + Cost of the ring-binders
   - Total cost = $55 + $54 = $109

Therefore, the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store is <final_answer>109</final_answer>.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randy’s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of biscuits Randy had.
2. Add the biscuits given by his father.
3. Add the biscuits given by his mother.
4. Subtract the biscuits eaten by his brother.

Let's break it down:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 more biscuits:
   \[
   32 + 13 = 45
   \]
3. His mother gave him 15 more biscuits:
   \[
   45 + 15 = 60
   \]
4. His brother ate 20 biscuits:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Georgia is working on a math test with 75 problems on it. After 20 minutes she has completed 10 problems. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems. She has 40 minutes to complete the rest of the test. How many problems does she have left to solve?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. Georgia starts with 75 problems.
2. After 20 minutes, she has completed 10 problems. So, the number of problems left at this point is:
   \[
   75 - 10 = 65 \text{ problems}
   \]
3. After another 20 minutes, she has completed twice as many problems as she did in the first 20 minutes. Since she completed 10 problems in the first 20 minutes, she completes:
   \[
   2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ problems}
   \]
   in the next 20 minutes. So, the total number of problems she has completed after 40 minutes is:
   \[
   10 + 20 = 30 \text{ problems}
   \]
4. The number of problems left after 40 minutes is:
   \[
   75 - 30 = 45 \text{ problems}
   \]

Therefore, the number of problems Georgia has left to solve is 45.

Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda in their school's Book Tournament. Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read, and Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read. If Candice read 18 books, how many books did Patricia read?
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of books Amanda read:**
   - Candice read 3 times as many books as Amanda.
   - Candice read 18 books.
   - Therefore, Amanda read \( \frac{18}{3} = 6 \) books.

2. **Determine the number of books Kara read:**
   - Kara read half the number of books that Amanda read.
   - Amanda read 6 books.
   - Therefore, Kara read \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) books.

3. **Calculate the number of books Patricia read:**
   - Patricia read 7 times the number of books that Kara read.
   - Kara read 3 books.
   - Therefore, Patricia read \( 7 \times 3 = 21 \) books.

Thus, the number of books Patricia read is <final_answer>21</final_answer>.

Randy had 32 biscuits. His father gave him 13 biscuits as a gift. His mother gave him 15 biscuits. Randy’s brother ate 20 of these biscuits. How many biscuits are Randy left with?
Output:
To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of biscuits Randy had.
2. Add the biscuits given by his father.
3. Add the biscuits given by his mother.
4. Subtract the biscuits eaten by his brother.

Let's break it down:

1. Randy initially had 32 biscuits.
2. His father gave him 13 more biscuits:
   \[
   32 + 13 = 45
   \]
3. His mother gave him 15 more biscuits:
   \[
   45 + 15 = 60
   \]
4. His brother ate 20 biscuits:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]

So, Randy is left with 40 biscuits.

Output:
To determine how much more money Classroom A needs to reach its goal, we first need to calculate the total amount of money raised so far.

1. Calculate the total amount raised from the two families who each contributed $20:
\[ 2 \times 20 = 40 \]

2. Calculate the total amount raised from the eight families who each contributed $10:
\[ 8 \times 10 = 80 \]

3. Calculate the total amount raised from the ten families who each contributed $5:
\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

4. Add these amounts together to find the total amount raised so far:
\[ 40 + 80 + 50 = 170 \]

5. The goal is to raise $200. Subtract the amount raised so far from the goal to find out how much more is needed:
\[ 200 - 170 = 30 \]

Therefore, the amount of money Classroom A still needs to reach the goal is:

Input:
Julieta went to the store to buy a backpack and three ring-binders for her school supplies. She knew the backpack was $50, and each ring-binder cost was $20. However, at the store, she found out that the price of a back had increased by $5, and the price of a ring-binder had reduced by $2. Calculate the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store.
Output:
Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Prices:**
   - Backpack: $50
   - Ring-binder: $20

2. **Price Changes:**
   - Backpack price increased by $5.
   - Ring-binder price reduced by $2.

3. **New Prices:**
   - New price of the backpack: $50 + $5 = $55
   - New price of each ring-binder: $20 - $2 = $18

4. **Quantity Purchased:**
   - Julieta bought 1 backpack and 3 ring-binders.

5. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Cost of the backpack: $55
   - Cost of 3 ring-binders: 3 * $18 = $54

6. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of the backpack + Cost of the ring-binders
   - Total cost = $55 + $54 = $109

Therefore, the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store is <final_answer>109</final_answer>.

Input:
On a farm, on average every 6 cows produce 108 liters of milk per week. In five weeks the cows produced 2160 liters of milk. How many cows are on the farm?
Output:
Step 1: Calculate the weekly milk production per cow.
To do this, we can divide the total weekly milk production by the number of cows that produce it. So, 108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters/cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
To do this, we can multiply the weekly milk production per cow by the number of weeks. So, 18 liters/cow per week * 5 weeks = 90 liters/cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cows on the farm.
To do this, we can divide the total milk production over five weeks by the milk production per cow over five weeks. So, 2160 liters / 90 liters/cow = 24 cows.

Therefore, the number of cows on the farm is <final_answer>24</final_answer>.

To do this, we can divide the total weekly milk production by the number of cows that produce it. So, 108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters/cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
To do this, we can multiply the weekly milk production per cow by the number of weeks. So, 18 liters/cow per week * 5 weeks = 90 liters/cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cows on the farm.
To do this, we can divide the total milk production over five weeks by the milk production per cow over five weeks. So, 2160 liters / 90 liters/cow = 24 cows.

Therefore, the number of cows on the farm is <final_answer>24</final_answer>.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cows on the farm.
To do this, we can divide the total milk production over five weeks by the milk production per cow over five weeks. So, 2160 liters / 90 liters/cow = 24 cows.

Therefore, the number of cows on the farm is <final_answer>24</final_answer>.

To do this, we can divide the total weekly milk production by the number of cows that produce it. So, 108 liters / 6 cows = 18 liters/cow per week.

Step 2: Calculate the total milk production per cow over five weeks.
To do this, we can multiply the weekly milk production per cow by the number of weeks. So, 18 liters/cow per week * 5 weeks = 90 liters/cow over five weeks.

Step 3: Calculate the number of cows on the farm.
To do this, we can divide the total milk production over five weeks by the milk production per cow over five weeks. So, 2160 liters / 90 liters/cow = 24 cows.

Therefore, the number of cows on the farm is <final_answer>24</final_answer>.
