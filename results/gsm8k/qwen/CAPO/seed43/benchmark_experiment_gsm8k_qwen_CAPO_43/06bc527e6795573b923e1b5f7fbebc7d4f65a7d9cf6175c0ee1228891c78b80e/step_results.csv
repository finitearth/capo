Input: Kim orders a $10 meal and a drink for 2.5.  She gives a 20% tip.  She pays with a $20 bill.  How much does she get in change?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we'll break it down into several steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the meal and drink:**
   - Meal cost: $10
   - Drink cost: $2.5
   - Total cost before tip: \( 10 + 2.5 = 12.5 \)

2. **Calculate the tip:**
   - Tip percentage: 20%
   - Tip amount: \( 12.5 \times 0.20 = 2.5 \)

3. **Calculate the total cost including the tip:**
   - Total cost including tip: \( 12.5 + 2.5 = 15 \)

4. **Determine the change from the $20 bill:**
   - Amount paid: $20
   - Total cost: $15
   - Change received: \( 20 - 15 = 5 \)

Input: Tina has 12 pink pens. She has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. How many pens does Tina have in total?
Output: user
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of pink pens Tina has:**
   - Tina has 12 pink pens.

2. **Determine the number of green pens Tina has:**
   - Tina has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens.
   - Number of green pens = Number of pink pens - 9
   - Number of green pens = 12 - 9 = 3

3. **Determine the number of blue pens Tina has:**
   - Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens.
   - Number of blue pens = Number of green pens + 3
   - Number of blue pens = 3 + 3 = 6

4. **Calculate the total number of pens Tina has:**
   - Total number of pens = Number of pink pens + Number of green pens + Number of blue pens
   - Total number of pens = 12 + 3 + 6 = 21

Input: Julieta went to the store to buy a backpack and three ring-binders for her school supplies. She knew the backpack was $50, and each ring-binder cost was $20. However, at the store, she found out that the price of a back had increased by $5, and the price of a ring-binder had reduced by $2. Calculate the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store.
Output: user
To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps:

1. **Initial Prices:**
   - Backpack: $50
   - Ring-binder: $20

2. **Price Changes:**
   - Backpack price increased by $5.
   - Ring-binder price reduced by $2.

3. **New Prices:**
   - New price of the backpack: $50 + $5 = $55
   - New price of each ring-binder: $20 - $2 = $18

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Julieta buys one backpack and three ring-binders.
   - Cost of one backpack: $55
   - Cost of three ring-binders: 3 * $18 = $54

5. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of one backpack + Cost of three ring-binders
   - Total cost = $55 + $54 = $109

Therefore, the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store is <final_answer>109</final_answer>.

Input: Bret takes a 9 hour train ride to go to Boston.   He spends 2 hours reading a book, 1 hour to eat his dinner, and 3 hours watching movies on his computer.  How many hours does he have left to take a nap?
Output: user
To solve this problem, we need to determine how many hours Bret has left to take a nap after accounting for the time he spends on other activities during his 9-hour train ride.

1. **Total train ride duration**: 9 hours
2. **Time spent reading**: 2 hours
3. **Time spent eating**: 1 hour
4. **Time spent watching movies**: 3 hours

First, we sum up the time spent on these activities:
\[ 2 \text{ hours (reading)} + 1 \text{ hour (eating)} + 3 \text{ hours (watching movies)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we subtract the total time spent on these activities from the total duration of the train ride to find out how many hours are left for Bret to take a nap:
\[ 9 \text{ hours (total train ride)} - 6 \text{ hours (activities)} = 3 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number of hours Bret has left to take a nap is:

Input: Tina has 12 pink pens. She has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens. Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens. How many pens does Tina have in total?
Output: user
Let's break down the problem step by step.

1. **Identify the number of pink pens Tina has:**
   - Tina has 12 pink pens.

2. **Determine the number of green pens Tina has:**
   - Tina has 9 fewer green pens than pink pens.
   - Number of green pens = Number of pink pens - 9
   - Number of green pens = 12 - 9 = 3

3. **Determine the number of blue pens Tina has:**
   - Tina has 3 more blue pens than green pens.
   - Number of blue pens = Number of green pens + 3
   - Number of blue pens = 3 + 3 = 6

4. **Calculate the total number of pens Tina has:**
   - Total number of pens = Number of pink pens + Number of green pens + Number of blue pens
   - Total number of pens = 12 + 3 + 6 = 21

Therefore, the total number of pens Tina has is <final_answer>21</final_answer>.

Input: Julieta went to the store to buy a backpack and three ring-binders for her school supplies. She knew the backpack was $50, and each ring-binder cost was $20. However, at the store, she found out that the price of a back had increased by $5, and the price of a ring-binder had reduced by $2. Calculate the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store.
Output: user
To solve this problem, we can break it down into several steps:

1. **Initial Prices:**
   - Backpack: $50
   - Ring-binder: $20

2. **Price Changes:**
   - Backpack price increased by $5.
   - Ring-binder price reduced by $2.

3. **New Prices:**
   - New price of the backpack: $50 + $5 = $55
   - New price of each ring-binder: $20 - $2 = $18

4. **Total Cost Calculation:**
   - Julieta buys one backpack and three ring-binders.
   - Cost of one backpack: $55
   - Cost of three ring-binders: 3 * $18 = $54

5. **Total Amount Spent:**
   - Total cost = Cost of one backpack + Cost of three ring-binders
   - Total cost = $55 + $54 = $109

Therefore, the total amount of money Julieta spent at the store is <final_answer>109</final_answer>.
